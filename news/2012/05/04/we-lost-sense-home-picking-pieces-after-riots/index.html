        <p><i>This is the fifth and final installment in our series of Q&As with members of the South L.A. community about the <a href="../../../04/29/shattering-south-la-20-years-after-riots/index.html" target="_blank">riots of 1992.</a></i></p>

<p>It's estimated that the '92 L.A. riots caused approximately $1 billion in damage – more than $1.6 billion in 2012 money – in addition to more than 50 killed and thousands of people injured.</p>

<p>But the riots took another toll – on survivors, on people who lived in the neighborhoods before, during and after the civil unrest in South Los Angeles exploded in one violent cacophony.</p>

<p>Maria Muniz was five years old in 1992. Now a full-time outreach worker at Community Coalition South L.A., the first home Muniz remembers was near 85th Street and Vermont Avenue. Her predominantly Latino neighborhood was safe, she says – when you're a kid, "your whole world consists of the block you live on."</p>

<p>Both of her parents were Mexican immigrants; her father had "really successful welding business" and was the "anchor" of the close-knit family, as Muniz puts it. Before 1992, she said, "I had a pretty good life." </p>

<p>Then the riots happened, shattering the happy life that she and her family had enjoyed. It was no longer safe to play in the street, as it once had been, and they had to move because of the damage their house on 85th and Vermont had sustained. So they moved: first to Mexico, then to 83rd and Avalon, then to Norwalk, than to 85th Street, then to 84th Street, ultimately ending up near Florence and Broadway, less than five miles east of where the riots began.</p>

<p>On top of that, her family had begun to drift apart, until finally they could no longer take the strain. Maria Muniz had walked the tragic path from a "pretty good life" to a life broken by a series of events that brought an entire metropolis to its knees.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>April 29, 1992. What happened?</b><br />I remember that specific day. I couldn't understand what was going on outside. We just turned on the TV and we saw what the media was covering – the fires, the violence, the people running around. And I remember the panicked look in my mother's face because my dad was out in the field. He was installing a fence in a different community, and all his equipment was in his truck. So she was afraid he was going to get robbed or stopped.</p>

<p>My dad called to see how we were doing, and my mom discreetly went into the room to talk on the phone, and my older sister and I were just like, "What's going on? Is our dad OK? Is he going to come home?" And afterward, my mom would look out the window and just say my dad's name. And every time she said my dad's name, my sister and I would just cry, because we didn't understand what was going on. We thought our dad was hurt and the TV wasn't helping at all. We saw the Vermont area – and I live really close to Vermont – and we were just like, "Are they going to come and attack our house too?" </p>

<p>By no means was it a racial thing for me – I saw Latinos and African-Americans on TV and knew they lived in the community. I was thinking, "These are our people. Why were our people messing up our own community?"</p>

<p><b>You were thinking about that when you were five years old?</b><br />Yeah. Mainly because I knew my community was Latino. And my parents always emphasized my heritage and my people. They would tell me, "You're light-skinned, but you are not white. You're Mexican."</p>

<p><b>So as a five-year-old, you were already aware of your heritage, probably on a deeper level than most five-year-olds.</b><br />I knew very much that I was Mexican, that my parents were immigrants, and they would tell us the struggles they went through to get to the U.S. so we would be appreciative of what we had. Like my dad did with our community – he would take it to heart when someone put graffiti on the wall, because he thought they were destroying the neighborhood.</p>

<p>And once everything happened, I was kind of in shock. I was confused, I didn't know why people weren't taking pride in what they had.</p>

<p><b>What happened when your dad got home?</b><br />When my dad got home, I remember he packed his equipment in his truck.</p>

<p><b>What was it like watching your dad pack everything up?</b><br />I didn't understand why he was so frantic, so rushed. Even the guys the had helping him were rushing to get everything inside because they didn't want to leave anything out in the open. Because even though there wasn't easy access to our house, they didn't want to leave anything outside, because they were afraid it wouldn't be there the next day. Once he was inside, the paint store on the corner near where we lived caught on fire. </p>

<p>Pretty much the entire side of Vermont near where I lived caught on fire. And the fire trickled down the alley and went into the back of my house. And that's where my dad had his equipment and where he would weld and where his shop was. I remember when it caught on fire, my dad and my mom said, "What are we going to do?" They couldn't call the fire department because the fire department wae preoccupied with what was going on in the streets. So my mom and dad packed a few suitcases and we left to go stay with an aunt and uncle in Compton.</p>

<p><b>What was it like watching your parents pack those suitcases</b>?<br />We didn't know what was going on. We thought, "Are we going on a trip? Are we going to visit abuelita?" We didn't know anything. And we didn't want to leave. </p>

<p>My father was afraid to go in the street because he didn't want to get the car to get stopped or for anything to happen to us.</p>

<p>On the way there, my mom asked my dad, "¿Que quieres hacer?" What do you want to do? And my dad goes, "Well, you guys can go to Mexico for a bit."</p>

<p><b>When you heard that––</b><br />I was like, "No!" I wanted to go to school, I had my friends here. But my mom told me and my sister to think of it as a vacation. And once we got to my uncle's house, they "discussed" – and they never discussed anything in front of us.</p>

<p><b>And throughout all of this, you literally have no clue what's going on.</b><br />Yeah. I didn't know my life was going to change so much that day. So we went to Mexico and stayed with my mom and my mom's family for what seemed like forever. At first, it was just supposed to be three months, and then it went longer. Then we came back after five, six months. It seemed like forever.</p>

<p>My dad stayed up here, trying to get things back together, trying to get things going again. Trying to figure out what to do and what happened. When we finally came back, it was just my brother and my sister and I who came back. My mom was undocumented at the time, so she couldn't come back with us, and we stayed with our uncle again. And we waited for our mom to cross the border.</p>

<p>When she finally crossed the border, after what seemed like an eternity, when we saw her, the physical state that she was in was something that no child should ever have to see in their mother. She was bruised, she was bleeding from her knees. It was just really shocking for us to see our mom like that. She'd crossed through a tunnel and told us she'd had to crawl on sand. And she told us when she crossed, she got in a van, and the way they were sitting made her knees burst open more. </p>

<p>And when she got here, we thought we got to go back home. And my dad said we were going to go home. But when we went home, it wasn't the home we'd had before. It was a garage behind a house.</p>

<p><b>How was it that you ended up there?</b><br />We'd lost pretty much everything when our house caught on fire and was destroyed. At this new house, we had probably 20 to 30 percent of the stuff we'd had before.</p>

<p>It was a horrible, horrible reality to walk into that house. We had to switch schools; we had to switch everything since we'd moved from our old area.</p>

<p>Our old house was a three-bedroom house, a huge front yard and my dad's business in the backyard. We were doing pretty well, and to go from that to a small one-bedroom garage that we barely fit in? </p>

<p><b>Did you feel wronged?</b><br />I think at the time, I didn't understand what happened. Now as an adult, I kind of do. I have that "what if" – what if my life had been a little different, what if the riots hadn't occurred, what if my dad hadn't lost his business. What would have happened, or would we have had the same life that we did?</p>

<p><b>When you think about that, what do you feel?</b><br />Although I don't agree with what happened, I understand it. I understand that the riots were an outlet to the frustration and neglect of injustices going on at the time. But sometimes I think about what if they'd found a different alternative to burning down everything or violence.</p>

<p>My house was burned and I had to move away from my community, which I considered my whole world. And I was thrown into somewhere else.</p>

<p><b>How was it adjusting to the new place?</b><br />We didn't even last there a year. My parents were obviously not very happy being there because it was so small. We moved to Norwalk and had a huge apartment that was bigger than our house. But my dad never fully recuperated from the loss we took, he never really got back on his feet. And he did a series of jobs, both legal and illegal, to try and make ends meet.</p>

<p><b>Illegal?</b><br />He became a bouncer at a club and started selling drugs as a result of that. And as a result of his selling drugs, my dad was shot in the leg – and that stopped his selling quick. </p>

<p>But the economical and emotional drain on my parents was too much. They couldn't handle it as a couple and they eventually ended up separating, and my mom took the kids and we ended up moving back to South L.A. near 85th.</p>

<p><b>Did you accompany your mom willingly?</b><br />No. I actually went with my dad for a week before and when they were trying to separate, I left with my dad. Because my dad was my world. My dad was the center, my everything – at the time. And my sister ended up being sick because I'd left. Because my sister and I were pretty close. And when I went back with my mom, I felt relieved because I knew people there. I was happy that I was in a familiar place, but I wasn't happy because of the struggles my family was going through.</p>

<p>My mom went from having to raise three kids to needing to have three jobs to raise the three kids. </p>

<p><b>And your dad?</b><br />My dad was completely out of the picture. He completely just took off. He was gone until I turned 12. When he came back into the picture, it was on and off. </p>

<p>Now as an adult, he's fully in our lives, but just growing up, he wasn't there.</p>

<p><b>What was it like getting away to college at UC Santa Barbara?</b><br />Once I was in Santa Barbara and I was able to look at my community from the outside looking in – I saw so many more things that were wrong with it, so many more socioeconomic conditions that were just not right, in terms of resources and school and the quality of life that people in South L.A. had. The neglect from everybody in the community – the fact that Vermont never got rebuilt and was just vacant lots.</p>

<p><b>What did you do after you graduated?</b><br />Santa Barbara wasn't for me – my family wasn't there and I wanted to be with family. And I'd already been away from them for five years. When I moved back, I told my mom that we weren't in the position to buy a house, we that we could definitely live in a bigger house. I had the choice to live on my own, outside of the community, or come back and take my mom out of the pretty bad place she was living in – looking back, it was a horrible place to live – so we found a bigger place, which is where we live now.</p>

<p>Now it's just my brother, my mom and I. And the quality of life we have now is so much better than before the move. And even though it's not where I pictured I would be, it's a start to where I could be.</p>

<p><b>How is the quality of life you have now compared to the quality of life you had before the riots?</b><br />There's no comparison. When I was five, it was better. We didn't have any financial problems – to my knowledge; we didn't worry about making rent or who was going to put food on the table because my dad's business not only took care of my family, but also our family in Mexico. </p>

<p>Now, we're not struggling, but we're on a budget. </p>

<p><b>A two-decade anniversary is kind of an arbitrary anniversary, but I'd imagine you do a lot of reflecting on the riots without waiting for anniversaries.</b><br />You know, here at the Community Coalition, we're doing a lot of events around the riots. I had a conversation with my mother about it, and it was crazy how she thought it didn't effect us, how she thought we kind of just walked it off. And I said no – it's still a sore that I have that's not fixed. And it still hurts. Because there's nothing here. We have to go outside the community for everything – decent food. The businesses never came back. And as many plans and sketches and agreements as there were, nothing was ever resolved.</p>

<p><b>What kinds of emotions are associated with that looking back?</b><br />Anger and sadness. It makes me angry to see it, to think that we lost everything, to think that my family was destroyed because of the riots.</p>

<p>At the same time, it makes me really sad to see that this is what it took for my community to take a stance – my community had to invoke all this violence in order to prove a point that some think still hasn't been proven. But I think that the fact that they had to be so violent about the injustices going on – and the Rodney King incident was just one out of so many that happened to be televised, so people saw what it did, but there were so many others like it – it was like a slap in the face to my community when the officers were acquitted.</p>

<p>We lost a sense of home. You can't call an empty lot home.</p>

<p><b>Why do you stay?</b><br />Because of the Coalition. I became involved with them when I was 12 because I could just walk down the street. Once I started, I had a sense of what was going on in our neighborhood – I always thought it was politicized, but not to the extent it is. They guided me though my political awareness and helped me see what my community could be, and unless people work for it, it's not going to be something that happens overnight.</p>

<p>And this is home to me. This is home. This is where I grew up and where my family is. I want to see my community change. I want to see my community become what it can be. But I know if I don't do it – and I know it's cliché – I can't just wait for someone else to do it.</p>
