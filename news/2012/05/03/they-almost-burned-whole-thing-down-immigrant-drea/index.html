        <p><i>This is the fourth in the series of Q&As with members of the South L.A. community about the <a href="../../../04/29/shattering-south-la-20-years-after-riots/index.html" target="_blank">riots of 1992.</a></i></p>

<p>Alex Ko and his parents learned the hard way that achieving the immigrant dream doesn't guarantee keeping it.</p>

<p>Ko's parents immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea in 1977 – with a young Ko himself – and began working immediately: his dad doing various jobs in manual labor, his mom in a sweatshop. They did that for seven years, until they opened up Olympic Video, on the corner of West 3rd and Catalina streets. They then opened up another business, 23 Hour Photo, just blocks away. Later, his mom would open yet another store in Redondo Beach. With three businesses, Ko's family was living the American dream.</p>

<p>"I remember my dad saying he'd come to America and worked hard and became an owner," said Ko, now 35. "He had a piece of something here. Things were going well for my family."</p>

<p>That's in part because they worked hard – Ko said his parents would leave at 8 a.m. and wouldn't get home until around 11 p.m. Day in and day out, they went to work, and not in the nicest areas, either.</p>

<p>"Koreatown was pretty dangerous," he said. At the time, Ko and his folks lived in Palos Verdes. "There were gang members. Some of their customers were gang members. You could see the tats on their face and arms. They would leave graffiti on the walls of the store."</p>

<p>In fact, residents got so fed up with gang activity and violence, they organized a march against it. That didn't work.</p>

<p>"The community members picketed down the street, and somebody drove by with a gun and shot at them, or in the air," said Ko. That was the late '80s, when Ko was a teenager.</p>

<p>Ko was 15 when the riots broke out, and he says it's only in hindsight that he realizes how dangerous the area was. His parents weren't naive about the danger or the racial tension surrounding the Rodney King case, but they also didn't pit themselves against other ethnicities, or sense that other ethnicities were doing that to them.</p>

<p>The Ko family, along with the rest of L.A., was about to be rudely, devastatingly awakened.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>Prior to 1992, did your parents ever say anything about the violence in the area?</b><br />I mean, they knew it was dangerous. If I talked to Koreans their age, or even my age, about what it was like back then, that's one of the things that comes up: It was dangerous back then. Not that it was a war zone or anything, but it was more dangerous than it is now.</p>

<p><b>On to '92 – do you remember where you were when the four officers were acquitted?</b><br />I was at home. It was all over TV, and I remember my dad saying that he knew that if the verdict came down and cleared the officers, that things would be really bad. He had prayed for a couple days that the officers wouldn't get off.</p>

<p><b>When you saw they'd gotten off, what did you think?</b><br />I was shocked. I couldn't believe it. It seemed so obvious that they had just brutalized Rodney King. The evidence was right there that they had brutalized this guy and then they got off. I didn't know that people would be so upset. I didn't have the consciousness to know that there were larger social ramifications.</p>

<p><b>What went through your own mind when you saw the tape of the King beating?</b><br />I think it was just shock. I'd never seen anything like that before. I didn't even know that could happen.</p>

<p><b>Did that make you wary or fearful of the LAPD?</b><br />No. I didn't think it would happen to me. Part of it had to do with the sensational nature of it – nothing like that had ever been on TV and now it was on TV all the time. It was this media event. </p>

<p><b>After the verdict, when did you first learn that there was violence?</b><br />Not long afterwards – there was stuff at Parker Center and down in South Central, then it was just non-stop coverage of the mayhem.</p>

<p>The things that come into my mind are the images of people protesting in front of Parker Center and smashing the windows, and then the helicopter coverage of the riots just starting in South Central.</p>

<p><b>As a 15-year-old, what was going through you mind?</b><br />It was just surreal. I think it was disorienting. It's something that I think I would have normally associated with some sort of movie – that kind of pandemonium, things burning, things that crazy happening. It seemed fictional, but it was actually happening.</p>

<p>And you could tell from the way some news anchors were talking about what was going on that it was out of control. Newscasters were saying, "This is not good." It was surreal.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>Were you scared?</b><br />I'm sure I was scared on some level. When I got really scared was when I figured out that this was going to spread to my parents' store.</p>

<p>I remember the helicopter coverage was going on, and I think on the second or third day, the helicopter was flying over where my parents' store was and I saw the store and it was smoking. And my folks – I remember there being phone calls at night, trying to figure out what to do. My dad had been there, but it was getting crazy, and fearing for his life, my dad left.</p>

<p>Right when the riots were about to happen, things had worked out for my parents. They had the immigrant dream. They had these two stores in Koreatown, and my mother had another business in Redondo Beach. So they had three businesses. My mom was down in Redondo Beach and my dad at the stores, and she came home and told my dad to come home too. She said, "Things are getting too crazy. Just come home. It's not worth it. Just come home."</p>

<p>And he came home. And I remember him telling me that he had to go back to protect the business, and that he might not be coming back. And that I had to take care of my family.</p>

<p><b>What did he mean when he said he might not be coming back?</b><br />That he would die. He'd gotten himself a gun, he had to go down to the store and he might not be coming back, so I had to take care of my mother and brother if he didn't come back.</p>

<p><b>What did it feel like to hear your father tell you he might be dying?</b><br />There's a point in the movie "Goodfellas" where one of the characters is inside a diner, and the camera pulls back, and does this effect where the background and the foreground compress – and it's like this really surreal feeling. That's almost how I felt. I remember looking at my father and he seemed really far away, impossibly far away, but I was sitting right next to him. Like some kind of weird warp.</p>

<p><b>Were you a pretty tight-knit family?</b><br />Yes. Most of my extended family immigrated from Korea, and we were all like one large tribe. </p>

<p><b>What happened after your dad left?</b><br />After he leaves, he tells me he couldn't even make it down there to the store. Traffic was insane. He saw cops going in the opposite direction from where the riots where, and when he saw that, he knew that they'd given up. The store was gone, the whole neighborhood was gone. He would say the LAPD had sacrificed the Koreans and Koreatown. Everything was on fire.</p>

<p>He hadn't been harmed. But my uncle who worked with him there didn't live that far from the store – he went down to the store, to try and see what was going on. There were people there who were trying to loot the store, and he tried to stop them, and this mob of people attacked him and they almost killed him. He was hurt really badly. Some of his customers, the people that knew him, rescued him. Had they not rescued him, they probably would've been beaten to death.</p>

<p>All for videos.</p>

<p><b>That was all on the second day of the riots. What was the rest of that week like?</b><br />To be honest, the rest of it is kind of a blur. It's like trying to remember a dream. 23 Hour Photo was burned to the ground and Olympic Video had been looted and partially burned.</p>

<p><b>What did you and your parents see when they returned to their shops in Koreatown?</b><br />I didn't go back to see it. They didn't take me to see the aftermath. But they said all that was left of 23 Hour Photo were the support beams. Olympic had been looted.</p>

<p><b>What did you feel as a family after it sunk in that those two businesses had been destroyed?</b><br />It was devastating. I remember being scared and confused, and the loss of those businesses was just sort of the initial impact. The riots scarred our family for a long time. Even now, inside somewhere, we're still hurt by it.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>Were your parents able to recover financially and get back to the level they'd been at?</b><br />Twenty years later, yeah. It's been 20 years. There was a lot of toil for them, and sacrifice – and a lot of drama in the family. My father was depressed; my mother was depressed; they fought all the time. They were really volatile.</p>

<p><b>And they didn't used to be that way.</b><br />Not that I remember. I mean, my dad always had kind of a temper. But no. It was different.</p>

<p><b>You directed a <a href="http://www.snagfilms.com/films/title/pok_dong" target="_blank">documentary</a> about the L.A. riots and your family's experience in 2006. Was that the first time you sat down and reflected on the riots as a whole?</b><br />Yeah, it was. I had talked to my parents about it, but to the level I explored it in the film, never.</p>

<p>It brought up things I may have known on an unconscious level but never really thought about or heard from my parents – just a lot of details I'd never heard. For example, I knew that they'd had a good relationship with their customers, that they were chummy with them, but in the movies, they say they didn't know that Latinos and blacks were angry with Koreans. Because that wasn't their experience. </p>

<p>The other thing is I was surprised at the level of candor from my parents and how brave they were to be honest.</p>

<p><b>Your life was changed by this. Is there a level of resentment you feel toward the riots? Or what do you feel when you think about the riots?</b><br />Feeling-wise, day to day, I don't feel or think about it. Now, when it becomes April, I think about it and it stirs up old feelings. I feel sad this happened to my family and that we had to go through such a painful trauma. It's not so much the trauma itself anymore, I don't think – it's thinking about all the s*** that came down afterward. And what we had to go through.</p>

<p>And I also feel proud, or happy, in a strange way, that it didn't destroy us – that we persevered and we're thriving now. I don't think the bad feelings will ever entirely go away. It's just too much of a trauma; somewhere inside, there will always be a mark. </p>

<p><b>How would you articulate the effect the riots had on you?</b><br />I think the riots began a process for me of looking at the world more critically. I'm not saying that right afterward, I had a whole new outlook on the world, but the riots actually blew up what I thought the world was about and what my place was in it. It made me realize that there's serious problems in this country, in this world.</p>

<p>There are profound injustices. And you can't deny that before the riots, there was a pressure-cooker along racial lines in L.A., but I think that people made it seem like the blacks and Koreans and Latinos were at each other's throats, and it was this catalyzing event that set it off. And I think that did play a role, of course, but I think there were much larger forces at play they don't even talk about now.</p>

<p><b>What kind of forces?</b><br />Decades of neglect and despair of the inner city of Los Angeles. You have an entire part of the city that was just left behind. And those people were so marginalized and so upset and so angry, they almost burned the whole thing down. You can't blame that all on racism and racial tension. That's some deep s*** that goes back decades – to the foundation of this country, even.</p>

<p>There was the economic crisis in L.A. The economy was shot. People were already suffering in Los Angeles. They're already on the edge. There's a Bob Marley song that says a hungry mob is an angry mob. </p>

<p>To me, that's the main reason why this whole thing happened.</p>

<p><b>Neglect.</b><br />Neglect. People being f***** over, people who'd been f***** over for so long, that it'd built up and it was going to explode.</p>

<p><b>Are we in a better place?</b><br />I think it is better in some ways. We can go over the different statistics on why it's better – there's less crime, probably. Definitely the younger people I know have a much different sense of race and class than even I did or my parents did, and I think it's progressed in that way. And of course the LAPD was forced to change. It's not the terror that it was back in the early '90s.</p>

<p>But I think that some of the long-term structural issues in terms of economic injustice still remain. Most of the people there in Koreatown and South L.A. are the same working-class immigrant people: not that many options, not that many paths out of where they are.</p>

<p>And so in that sense, things haven't changed. There's a whole group of people who were left behind, and even after the riots, no one came back for them. No one's ever going to come back for them. And there's going to be reckoning for that, too.</p>
