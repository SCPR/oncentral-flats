        <p>Ninth District Councilwoman Jan Perry was present for the grand opening of the first phase of a new affordable housing complex on 29th Street on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Crossings on 29th Street, located near the 28th Street Elementary School, is the result of a collaboration between developer Urban Housing Communities (UHC), the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles (CRD/LA) and Perry's office. The first phase features 24 two-bedroom and 10 three-bedroom apartment homes occupying three three-story buildings.</p>

<p>"This is a transformative project that not only represents new affordable housing, but will change the face of this neighborhood from an industrial island to a residential oasis," said Perry, who called the event a "celebration." "We are standing on the promise of a better life. It's a promise to take this [area] from industrial to residential and to make sure families have safe, healthy and beautiful places to live."</p>

<p>A precise definition of "affordable housing" has proven elusive in the United States. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/affordablehousing/">general definition of affordability</a> is for household to pay no more than 30 percent of its total annual income on housing. Generally, the practice of affordable housing developers is to first determine the median income for an area in which they want to build, which is termed the "area median income" (AMI). Developers then determine how much the families at that AMI could afford to pay for housing per year, and then charge a percentage of that number. That percentage, called "percentage of AMI," varies and is largely based on a sliding scale, and determines how much families for that particular affordable housing complex will pay.</p>

<p>Doug Bigley, president of Urban Housing Communities, said that The Crossings is "true affordable." "For this development, [that] means people that earn between 30 and 60 percent of the area median income," he said. Bigley and The Crossings' property management, however, were unable to produce an exact AMI.</p>

<p>"We base [rent] on income," said Herica Galinda, the property manager. "[Tenants] can only make a certain amount per year to qualify for these units ... if they go over that amount, they won't qualify." Galinda provided OnCentral with a flyer, indicating that rent for a two-bedroom apartment could range from $559 to $1,119, and rent for a three-bedroom could range from $646 to $1,292, dependent on income. According to a flyer, a single-person household can earn up to $34,800 before it is no longer eligible for an apartment at The Crossings; a household of two, $39,780; a household of three, $44,760.</p>

<p>Griselda Arredondo, Galinda's supervisor, also said that Los Angeles city guidelines on income limits help determine what AMI percentage each family qualifies for. She said that at The Crossings, for example, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment at an AMI percentage of 30 will cost $599 per month and $1,265 at an AMI percentage of 60. Other factors, such as family size, also play a role. Arredondo could not provide a median income for the area in which The Crossings is located. </p>

<p>Bigley said the affordability aspect was crucial to building The Crossings and for his plans of continued expansion on that block. "For us, it's very important [that these places we're building are affordable], because that's what we do -- we have a family-owned business and we enjoy this," he said. "We had north of 600 applicants for these 34 units...the demand is high and the end product is satisfying. It's not really about this development, it's about these people ... I can't do a market-rate development and get the same social satisfaction that I do for providing this type of housing. So we're going to do affordable housing."</p>

<p>One resident of that housing is 13-year-old Robaldo Herrera, who was among the speakers at Thursday's grand opening. He broke into tears as he described his gratitude for his new home. "I am very thankful to everyone who gave us this opportunity to live here, because living in a garage isn't a very nice way [for a bunch of children to live]," he said. "I think it's really safe here. Where I used to live, having to think about all the danger that could be around the corner, not knowing what could happen next, having all the bugs and rats around the sewers and around the streets –- that really is a bad way for a bunch of kids to be living in."</p>

<p>At a later phase in the project, The Crossings will replace Palace Plating, a metal finishing company located on the same block <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/20/local/la-me-school-toxins-20111220">that closed last year as part of a settlement agreement with the city due to multiple environmental health violations</a>, with a neighborhood-serving alternative, like a park.</p>

<p>Bigley, who called the endeavor a "true public-private partnership," said that Perry's help was indispensable to completing the process, which he said began about six years ago. "You have an industrial island, so you have to buy the buildings and businesses, and then you have to go through relocation with all the people that are here. This is an environmentally sensitive area, because you have Palace Plating on one end, so we had to work through a lot of the environmental issues on this site -- we cleaned it up. It' a very clean site now. But any time you have environmental [issues] as a developer, I really don't want to deal with it unless someone helps me ... if it hadn't been for Jan, I'm telling you, things just aren't going to happen because she is just committed to getting this place cleaned up."</p>

<p>“This is really a wonderful day," Perry told event attendees. "I can’t even express to you how happy I am … years of hard work, you know it was worth it. Every bit of it. </p>

<p>"It's been a joy to see our dream come to life."</p>
