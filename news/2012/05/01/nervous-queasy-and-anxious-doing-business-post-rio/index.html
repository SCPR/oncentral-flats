        <p><i>This is the second in a series of Q&As with members of the South L.A. community about the <a href="../../../04/29/shattering-south-la-20-years-after-riots/index.html" target="_blank">riots of 1992</a>.</i></p>

<p>Common sense wouldn't dictate sticking around South L.A. after the '92 riots – especially for businesspeople.</p>

<p>It was a scary time for businesses on the southside, especially if there wasn't a "black-owned sign" posted outside. Many simply up and left, and some just couldn't recover after the damage they'd sustained during the violence, both in '92 and 1965. Bowers & Sons, a cleaners located near the intersection of Central and Adams avenues, wasn't one of those businesses. </p>

<p>Established in 1950, Bowers & Sons weathered both sets of riots and kept on with business as usual. Current president and owner Vivian Bowers didn't come on board until 1994, after she'd done stints in modeling, retail and the healthcare industry – and after the riots. That year, her brother had returned control of the cleaners to Bowers' parents after deciding he wanted to go back to his career of writing and film. Six months later, her dad said he was planning to sell it.</p>

<p>"I just thought about the loss that it would be to the community," said Bowers. "The business itself, but also the fact that if he didn't sell it to someone who could appreciate it the way we did as a family, or if he didn't sell it at all, it would just become a vacant building. And knowing the blight that had already proliferated the area since '65 and '92, I just didn't want to see that happen again."</p>

<p>So Bowers said, "I guess I'm the one."</p>

<p>She took over in 1994 and the establishment maintained its position as a fixture of Central Avenue – but not without some bumps in the road. "When I came, the area was very unsafe and business was extremely slow," she said.</p>

<p>Business picked up, though, and Bowers gradually assumed an increasingly visible role as a one of the community's leaders. Bowers & Sons now has two locations – the second is near Central and 41st Place – but it's been a long journey out of the destruction wreaked by the riots that began on April 29, 1992.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>What was the area like when you began working here?</b><br />I witnessed several drive-by shootings. I was petrified, so much so that I was going to have bulletproof glass as you see in a lot of places in our area installed at the counters, and reinforce the glass at the front of the building. I found out shortly after that in '95, '96 that right across the street was the largest dope house in the area. There was a house in the back and that's where they would do all their what-have-yous. I had no idea. And that's why the drive-by shootings were on that side.</p>

<p>Another thing that caused a lot of negativity in this area is that there were several phone booths around, which you don't see much anymore, and it was a place where drug-dealers could go or pushers could come and call. Prostitution was also was very, very rampant over here. And to this day you might see a few call girls real early in the morning and about seven or eight in the evening. So I had all the phone booths pulled out and that stopped some of it. I had the building repainted. I had local graffiti artists come and do graffiti art on both sides of the building, which immediately stopped the graffiti. </p>

<p>And just started to dig in and get involved. I was here and I would make the best of it. And I decided with God's grace and my determination I would not put the bulletproof glass. Instead I put in a panic button in case anything happened. And Newton Division was always good to respond, and are always good to respond.</p>

<p><b>Where where you in '92? You didn't own Bowers yet, correct?</b><br />I didn't. I was in Glendora in '92, and the day the riots began, I was coming to L.A. to visit my parents, and I talked to my mom and she said, "Look at the television – you can't come into town with the kids." And I said OK,  if it wasn't bad near our house in the Wilshire District, I'd go over there and we'd stay there together.</p>

<p>So as I'm watching it, I'm watching the fires ignite all over, in real time, because it's being televised and the helicopters are saying, wait a minute, there's another one over here and another one over here, which was unlike the '65 riots where it concentrated on Central and went north from there. For some reason, this one seemed strategic in that people had placed fire-starters or protestors throughout L.A., or sympathetic in that there were other people who were disturbed by the verdict and began their own outrage or outburst with fires and looting and all that. But they were popping up all over. And as I'm there, watching, my mom calls and says there's one right down the street from her house.</p>

<p>I asked where my dad was and she says he had to go over to the cleaners and put out a fire by the cleaners. He had to drive down here and meet my brother because someone had started a fire at the end of our building here and they came down because the fire department was so busy that we had to get down there because there was nobody there to put the fire out.</p>

<p><b>What did it feel like to know that, at that moment, this thing had happened that was so similar to what happened in '65, and the infrastructure wasn't there to help?</b><br />It was terrifying. Even now when I'm talking about it, I'm feeling very nervous, queasy and anxious. And I'm sure that's what I was feeling at the time. Because what the violence went down to the cleaners and somebody attacked my family? And you think too, he's a black man, they won't hurt him, they shouldn't hurt our father because they know who we are. </p>

<p>But at the same time, when you're angry you do things out of anger, and when there that kind of mob mentality, you have people from out of the area who don't know who owns the block or who owns the building. And you remember when those signs went up – "black-owned business." There were a lot of those signs being made as the riots progressed and put in windows.</p>

<p><b>Did your parents put one up?</b><br />No. I think because they're pillars in the community and people knew who they were. And we're well-protected; we're very well-insulated around here.</p>

<p><b>So what happened with the fire?</b><br />They were able, with the help of the people next door, to connect hoses and actually put out the fire. And didn't have another problem; they opened up the next day, the day after the riots began.</p>

<p><b>Were you in the shop at all during those days when the riots were raging?</b><br />No, just in communication. I did come down to see what happened and the damage was very limited because they'd put the fire out very quickly and business carried on. Probably it dipped a little bit, but it didn't have a very big impact on the business.</p>

<p><b>Was that exception or was that the rule? Were most businesses in the community unaffected or was Bowers & Sons unique in that regard?</b><br />You know, this area wasn't as affected this time as it was in '65. Again, keep in mind, in 1965 the riots started on Central and moved north. That was very devastating.</p>

<p>But this time, remember the fires were everywhere. They got as far northwest as Fairfax and Pico – and the other one had stopped around Central and Washington.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>So what was the damage of '65 like compared to the damage in '92?</b><br />'65 was horrific. There were many, many black-owned businesses at the time, a tremendous amount. And many of them were – excuse my expression – "black-face" businesses: They were owned by, say, Jewish people, but they had blacks managing or at least operating the day-to-day. In fact, people today will come in and, with all the improvements we've done at Bowers & Sons, they'll say, "This is not a black-owned business. There's no black-owned businesses that look like this on Central. Who's really your boss?"</p>

<p><b>Wow.</b><br />You know? It's amazing. And it's really heartbreaking to hear something like that. But of course I quickly turn their minds around.</p>

<p>So in '65, it was so bad that they were just looting and burning everything. And I don't know that a black-owned sign would have made a difference. In '92 it made a difference. And as a result of that, after '65, many of the people did not reopen.</p>

<p><b>Did your experience of '65 affect your experience of '92?</b><br />My parents are very resilient. And Dad, of course, is always the one that's going to step forward. He has no fear. He doesn't worry about things like this. He braces himself, does what he needs to do and goes on. I don't know how to describe it, whether it is the community, whether it's his self-confidence that he exudes that everything's going to be OK. And it's always been OK. And he continues going on about business as he normally would, with, I'm sure, precautions, but never any signage, never any weapons that I know of. But his presence and therefore our presence as a family has always been such that we're not threatening but we're never threatened. </p>

<p>In '65 I remember my parents to be nervous, but the anxiety and nervousness actually was more prevalent when the National Guard was rolling down the street in armored tanks and marching up and down the street with machine guns drawn and ready and telling us, "Don't come out the doors." I remember looking at them from inside. So that was really more frightening than the actual incident. And in '92, we didn't have that kind of presence around here.</p>

<p>I remember the helicopters circling, just the constant buzz of the helicopters all over.</p>

<p><b>Was there a point where things were suddenly silent?</b><br />Yes. It was eerie. There was a curfew placed, but a lot of it was self-imposed too, because people were very cautious as to whether or not they should go out, when they should go out, how they were going to be treated by authorities, especially as black and brown people. In this area, there were people who had participated in looting, I'm sure. People were literally just taking things. So I don't know if people were hiding. But the quiet was deafening. And there was smoldering too. You could smell it.</p>

<p><b>Was there a fear that as the dust began to settle that the lull was only temporary and that something would break out again?</b><br />I remember there being talks, and I remember being afraid that it would happen again because people were still unhappy – they were very angry about what had happened. And who knew again if it wasn't strategically planned, the way the fires broke out, so it was difficult for the fire department to get to every place? So if they did it once, could you come back and do it again once things had settled? I know I thought about that.</p>

<p><b>Did you change your behavior after the riots in any way?</b><br />The only behavior I can think of, and not that I frequent the area where it began, but Florence and Normandie – I would not go in that direction. If I were here and wanted to go the airport, you could certainly go in that area using surface streets. Or if I was going to visit someone in Inglewood, I could also go that way. But I would definitely have avoided it.</p>

<p><b>Even though you're black?</b><br />Yeah. I considered it a rough area and that anything could happen. Maybe they wouldn't hurt me intentionally, but certainly there was still crossfire, a lot of battling going on. Because now the gang mentality was even more heightened. So it was just random shooting. And I could have been there, or my kids could have been there.</p>

<p><b>So in the weeks and months following April '92, were things in general "heightened"? Was it tense?</b><br />In some areas, there may have been more violence – it seemed to me that the gang culture, the gang involvement seemed to increase for some reason, and maybe because they were already angered and the fire was already ignited, maybe someone had done something to their rival gang during the unrest. I don't know. And maybe people couldn't find work now. Maybe they burned themselves out of a job. Maybe someone looted their home or their business. I don't know the intricacies, but I do know it was a little more hostile, little more tense. </p>

<p>For me, as a black person working in a largely white environment [at the time], it was uncomfortable because my feeling was that they were looking at me like I was a part of it, or thinking, "What were my people doing?" since we were the ones that really started it, even though, from what I could see on camera, the actual looting and rioting was done across the board in terms of nationalities. Because people were either enraged or opportunists. But here, in L.A., the other thing that caused a lot of discomfort was the smoldering of the buildings. You could just smell it almost everywhere you went.</p>

<p>So you've got the tension in the air, you've got the odor in the air, you've got the curfew.</p>

<p><b>Before the riots began, had L.A. been at a boiling point?</b><br />Yes, it had to be. Because when [Rodney] King was beaten the way he was beaten, and it had been videotaped, so everyone could see it, there was a lot of discussion about the lack of justice and the what-ifs – "What if my child was driving down the freeway and does something slightly wrong?" "What if my husband is out there; what's going to happen?" "Is it open season on black and brown people, on minorities"? "What's going on with the LAPD?" I remember this question begin asked around the family kitchen table: Is it going to be like it was in L.A. where LAPD didn't give a darn about a black person, where they would kill you or beat you to within a breath of life and not really be concerned and not really have any repercussions?</p>

<p><b>So why did you decide to come back and stay in this area in '94?</b><br />I wanted to keep the family business going. I didn't think at that time that I was really risking anything. I didn't think about my safety, even though my children and my brother did. I thought about the fact that my parents made it all these years, so why couldn't it take care of me and my children like it did for them? And I also thought about the fact that since the riots, a lot of people have not reopened. And as you look around, even today, you see many vacant lots, where probably there was a building and it was destroyed. I can't say for sure that it was. But there was a lot of blight. But again, I say to you, I can see this block becoming one of those blocks. And my parents had worked too hard. But we, as kids, had too. We had all worked so hard that I just couldn't imagine it being gone and no one carrying on the legacy.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>It seems like since after the riots, South L.A. has been up and coming, even if the grade of that upswing is very slight. Is that accurate?</b><br />Well, I think so. It's been a slow rise. Oh, goodness, it's been a long time coming. And we're not there yet. I remember when I came back in '94, that I was told that there's a lot of programs available – the acronyms escape me, but it was funding for people who wanted to improve or expand their business or start new businesses in our area.</p>

<p>I didn't know about the funds until I set up here and realized my funds wouldn't work. So people began telling me about the public funds, so I went to a Business Expo and yes, sure enough, there were a lot of programs as a result of the '92 riots. It was two-and-a-half years later. So the programs were there and as I tapped into them – "No, we're almost out of money. No, we're not offering anything for that."</p>

<p>But there was a lot of money supposedly available, but I question that, because if it was readily available and so easily accessible, why did so many people leave and not rebuild? I asked my father that question, and he said "Because when minorities go to get the money, suddenly it's not there. Or they offer you $10-15,000. What are you going to do with that?" </p>

<p>Case in point: He did not ask for money in '92; in '65, he did, because the same kind of programs had come out after the Watts riots. On the phone, when he talked to them and he told them about his business, he was offered $125,000. When he got to whatever office it was and they saw who my dad was, they said, "Oh, no. I didn't speak to you. I don't know what you're talking about. But we are giving businesses money, so here's $25,000." He didn't take it.</p>

<p>I believe the same thing happened in '92. It was difficult to get insurance at that time, too. When I tried to renew my insurance after I got here, insurance companies wouldn't touch us. It was pretty bad. You don't want to be a business with what just happened without liability insurance.</p>

<p>So maybe the government was giving money to these organizations, but that money wasn't getting out to people.</p>

<p><b>Should the city have stepped in more?</b><br />Yes, I think they should have, but I don't know that they didn't try by infusing money into these organizations.</p>

<p><b>It was just the lack of accountability.</b><br />Yes. And I think that happens all the time. </p>

<p><b>Regarding South L.A.'s slow rise since 1992 – what's it been like?</b><br />In terms of the black and brown communities, certainly South Central, Watts, Baldwin Hills, Crenshaw area, it was a long time before anybody took interest in what was really going on. For our area here in particular – I've been here almost 20 years, and the interest didn't really begin until about three years ago. In 1997, [former L.A. City Councilwoman of the ninth district] Rita Walters was very instrumental, along with the community, in getting the police more involved and at least squelching the violence and the drugs. That had to go first.</p>

<p>Maybe it was because businesses were gone and there were no drugs – what are you going to do? Sell drugs. Sell dope. Then the gang wars and all of that happened. So our councilwoman was very adamant she was going to clean up this area. That was back in '97.</p>

<p><b>What happened between 1997 and three years ago?</b><br />Just a slow rise. You could just see things getting a little bit better. Different types of businesses opening; storefronts opening up; the influx of the Latino businesspeople who probably weren't afraid and hadn't experienced the riots. They also did business a little differently, so maybe a lack of insurance  or a lease or rental agreement wasn't a problem – they were there to take care of their family and do business. So they were able to come in, pay low rents and start business flowing again. Many of the homes were left vacant or for sale or for rent because – let's face it – it was a black community, but many of us had gotten into gang involvement so we were in prison, killed, on drugs, lost our homes, lost everything and others. There was the flight.</p>

<p><b>Because the odds were so stacked against a high quality of life here?</b><br />Yes. And especially against the children and especially male children – they were more prone to being involved in violence or the gang mentality. So you wanted to get them out of here. And those who weren't able to leave, many of them lost their property, and many of our young men went to jail. And many were, again, killed.</p>

<p>So the influx of the immigrant population began this sea change. And as we had that change in residents, the businesses began to flourish again, but with a different face. But in terms of the black businesses that were here, there are only a few of us left.</p>

<p><b>You've kind of taken the reins as much as you can in kicking South L.A.'s rise in upward gear, but it seems like the area still has a long way to go.</b><br />We have a long way to go. And I'm concerned. Redistricting has really posed another potential problem, and that is that if you draw an invisible line down Washington and you take away our economic engine –  Downtown – perhaps the concept would be, again, who wants to be involved over there? And when I say again, when I was coming back to the cleaners in 1994, many people would say, "Why do you want to go over there?" </p>

<p>What do you mean "over there'? This really is L.A. right here. We are in L.A.</p>

<p><b>What's going to get South L.A. to the next level, at least business-wise?</b><br />We have to work hard to present the image of success, of wanting to be professional, of taking pride in our community so that others will continue to want to join us in our revitalization. It's not that we don't have pride in our businesses, but as I try to explain to businesses when they come to meetings for the Central Avenue Business Association [of which Bowers is president] – it's important to keep your storefront looking good. It's important to keep your sidewalks clean. It's important to keep your windows open and airy so people can see not only for your safety, but so people are invited in. And as you present that image, your business is going to grow and other potential businesses will see you're doing well and they'll want to come back to the community.</p>

<p>Many people have this misconception that there's no money here. Well there are people, they're living, they're doing well – they're spending their money somewhere. We have to keep the interest and investment going somehow. We have our own economic engine here – we just have to make it work. We are a diamond in the rough; we just need to be refined. We have to make our voices heard.</p>
