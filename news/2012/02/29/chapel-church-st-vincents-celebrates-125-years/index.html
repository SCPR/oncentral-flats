        <p>Maybe the best part about St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church's celebrating of its 125th anniversary is that it can say it's in the midst of its <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/454178" target="_blank">"quasquidcentennial."</a></p>

<p>The parish, which since 1925 has been located on the corner of Adams Avenue and Figueroa Street, has a bit of a convoluted history. The origins of the current parish community began in the mid-19th century at the northwest corner of Washington Boulevard and Grand Avenue at the chapel of St. Vincent's College. St. Vincent's, established in 1865, was the first college in L.A., and in 1887 the chapel's first Mass was celebrated. </p>

<p>As the population of the city grew, so did the parish, to the point where the archdiocesan newspaper, The Tidings, said that "the number of parishioners is the largest in St. Vincent's history. It is certain that a new church will soon become a necessity."</p>

<p>That prediction proved true. In 1911, the City of Angel's first college closed its doors and became a parochial school. Mass continued to be celebrated in the "old St. Vincent's church" while construction on the new one -- the one that this year is celebrating is quasquidcentennial -- began. On April 5, 1925, Mass was celebrated for the first time in St. Vincent de Paul Church as it stands today.</p>

<p>Fr. Ruben Restrepo, C.M. has served as the parish's pastor for nearly six years. The suffix after his name stands for "Congregatio Missionis," Latin for Congregation of the Mission, a religious order that looks to St. Vincent de Paul as its founder. A native of Colombia, Restrepo became a priest in 1997 before moving to the U.S. in 2000. His mother was a large part of the reason he chose religious life.</p>

<p>"My family was poor at the time, and my mother used to go once a week to a nursing home and help people there," he said. "I used to go with her and later on I said, 'I want to go to mission, I want to do something' because I'd been doing that for many years with my mother. And my vocation, I think, was borne of that."</p>

<p>Restrepo, who described the parish's mission as "to follow Jesus Christ and work with the faithful, especially the poor," said his congregation is largely comprised of the working-class poor, including many immigrants, and isn't limited to residents of South L.A..</p>

<p>"Many people do come from this area, but some of them come from other parts of the city, like Hollywood, Inglewood, Riverside, Downey," he said. He pointed to their central location within L.A. as one reason for that -- among others.</p>

<p>"The place is beautiful," said Restrepo. "And our liturgy is beautiful and the people like the way we celebrate, they like our music and how we welcome them."</p>

<p>The numbers make that clear: Restrepo estimated that there are around 500 registered families in the paris -- but that nearly 7,000 people attend one of the parish's six Sunday Masses every week, two of which are in English and the rest of which are in Spanish.</p>

<p>"Most congregants are from Mexico, but we have people from Central America -- Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras," he said.</p>

<p>Among the parish's most popular ministries are its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Charismatic_Renewal" target="_blank">charismatic prayer</a> groups -- Restrepo estimated that between 200-300 people attend those meetings every Monday. Bible studies are also popular and well-attended, and the parish's Christian formation classes -- guided preparation for youth between the ages of nine and 17 for the sacraments of communion and confirmation -- see nearly 500 students every week.</p>

<p>Despite challenges faced by the broader Catholic Church -- the sex abuse crisis in particular -- Restrepo said he hasn't noticed people leaving the Church. For St. Vincent de Paul, the Latino factor plays a role in that.</p>

<p>"Most of the people are Spanish-speaking," he explained. "And when they know there is a priest who speaks Spanish and understands Latino culture, many people will come to that priest -- they'll follow that priest."</p>

<p>The sex abuse crisis has presented its challenges in terms of trust in the clergy, but not enough to keep people from attending St. Vincent's, said the priest. While the archdiocese has implemented <a href="http://www.la-archdiocese.org/org/protecting/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">measures</a> to protect children, Restrepo acknowledged that wasn't enough. "It's never enough," he said. "It's never enough. When something like [sex abuse] happens to somebody, it's never enough. But we need to keep going. And we need to prevent the people who commit those crimes."</p>

<p>"There are some people who are sad, but we cannot say that because [some] priests are doing this, all the priests are doing the same thing," he said. "And in some moments they hear that people are worried or they are said, but they still believe and they keep coming."</p>

<p>That kind of commitment is what the parish needs, said Restrepo, especially because of a lack of resources -- human resources. "One of the things we need is more commitment both from congregants and priests," he said. "We want to do more things but sometimes we cannot because we already have so much to do here. We need more time. We are few -- we want to do more but we cannot."</p>

<p>The laity -- those people who are not members of the clergy -- play a crucial role in this, he continued.</p>

<p>"St. Vincent's is blessed because we have 100 [lay] ministers," he said. "We are giving formation to those ministers, but I think we need more lay people. In the future, this place, without the laity, we are nothing." That's especially true given the shortage of priests, he pointed out.</p>

<p>Such are the challenges faced by a large parish like St. Vincent's. Perhaps another one will be holding its ground in the wake of the "competition" presented by the <a href="../../../01/19/storefront-church-growth-surges-south-los-angeles/index.html" target="_blank">storefront church</a> phenomenon, which Restrepo spoke of disapprovingly because they often attack the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>"I think in many cases they are not good because they are confusing the people, because they start saying bad things about other churches, like the Catholic Church," he said. "And that's not good. Here in the Catholic Church, we don't say things about the Protestant people, for example."</p>

<p>Restrepo also criticized their financial and formational practices. "In many of those small churches, the people [who run them] are taking advantage of the people [who go to them] because they are looking for money," he said. "And here [at St. Vincent's] we spend one to two years preparing people for communion -- they make preparation last one day. That's not enough time."</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, though, Restrepo said St. Vincent's has continued to serve its congregants and the wider Catholic community well -- and will continue to do so.</p>

<p>"When people come to Mass," he said. "They feel at home because they see many people from different countries and they feel this is the community, this is the family. And they keep growing because they feel happy coming to the Catholic Church. They feel at home."</p>
