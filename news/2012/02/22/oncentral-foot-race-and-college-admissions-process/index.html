        <p><i>In "OnCentral on Foot," we approach people at random in the streets of South L.A. and ask them their thoughts on the world and community in which they live. This time, we asked them whether they thought it was appropriate for race to be considered in the college admissions process. </p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/education/2012/02/21/4765/us-supreme-court-takes-college-affirmative-action-/" target="_blank">Tuesday</a> the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal from a white student in Texas who is challenging affirmative action in the University of Texas' admissions process. The case, which will be heard in October, <a href="http://www.scpr.org/programs/airtalk/2012/02/21/22610/affirmative-action-case" target="_blank">comes after</a> a 1978 Supreme Court ruling that universities can consider race as a factor in admitting new students. That ruling was confirmed again in 2004. In 2007, the Court banned the use of affirmative action in elementary or high schools to achieve racial balance. October's hearing will give the Supreme Court another opportunity to rule on whether affirmative action in higher education is constitutional.</i></p>

<p><b>Henry Vargaz</b>, 18<br /><b>Do you think race should be a factor in college acceptance decisions?</b><br />No, it shouldn't. It's all about education and I guess your effort and ambition -- if you want to go to college and do well and be successful, it depends on who you are, and not your color, your race or your ethnicity.</p>

<p><b>In a place like South L.A., if affirmative action isn't a solution, what is?</b><br />I don't know right there. Basically, go above the stereotype that we're lazy. I don't know honestly how to answer that question. But go for it. Prove them wrong.</p>

<p><b>Are you in school right now?</b><br />I'm going to college. I attend two schools -- Santa Monica and Los Angeles Trade Technical College. Total of six classes [every week], three at Trade Tech and three at Santa Monica.</p>

<p><b>Leticia Sanchez</b>, 18</p>

<p><b>Do you think race should be a factor in college acceptance decisions?</b><br />No, I don't. It doesn't matter what race a person is -- if they can actually get through college, it shouldn't matter what race they are. Anyone can do it, it's just whether somebody wants to or not.</p>

<p><b>Do you think it's always unfair to make race a factor in admissions?</b><br />Yes.</p>

<p><b>OK. Take a place like South L.A., where there are a lot of Latinos and black people who are born into poverty, and so it's hard for parents to send their kids to college. If affirmative action isn't a solution, what is?</b><br />I think the system is fine how it is. I mean, for people who aren't legal, there should be something to help them.</p>

<p><b>But a person who maybe doesn't have the grades because he or she went to high school in a poor area with very few resources -- affirmative action shouldn't be an option even then?</b><br />That's a hard question. I mean, they can go to a college that doesn't have as high of a standard. They can start off at the community college and work their way [up], prove that they're good enough.</p>

<p><b>Are you a student right now?</b><br />Yeah. I go to [Los Angeles Trade Technical College]. I study art.</p>

<p><b>Was that a difficult process getting into there?</b><br />No, it was fairly easy. Not that hard.</p>

<p><center>--</center></p>

<p><b>Abraham M.</b>, 35<br /><i>Abraham declined to provide his full name or have his photo taken.</i></p>

<p><b>Do you think race should be a factor in college acceptance decisions?</b><br />No. Race doesn't matter. People are people.</p>

<p><b>OK. Take a place like South L.A., if affirmative action isn't a solution, what is?</b><br />Affirmative action won't change anything. What does race have to do with anything? Of course, you have blacks and Hispanics living here. But they could just as easily be white or Asian. They could be any race. It just so happens that blacks and Hispanics are at the lower point of the money pit. We're not making that much money. But it's not because of schooling and stuff -- it's because we're constantly thinking of money. So at a young age, we want to make money, so we couldn't care less about going to school.</p>

<p><b>But isn't going to school one of the best ways to eventually earn a lot of money?</b><br />Yeah, but we're not taught that.</p>

<p><b>So the importance of going to school is not necessarily embedded in the Latino or black culture? Is that what you're saying?</b><br />Right. It's not. The parents try but we're exposed to a lot more out here [in South L.A.] than other neighborhoods. Right here you see things you're not going to really see in Gardena or Torrance or Culver City or Beverly Hills. So we get a different idea of life, [and] it's not the same thing. Out there, if parents say to go to school, you go to school. Out here, you say go to school, and at school you learn other ways to make money.</p>

<p><b>So is it fair to say that you think the way to improve minorities' educational situation starts at home?</b><br />With the parents -- educate the parents.</p>

<p><b>Is affirmative action a way to get that ball rolling, at least, until a better, more permanent solution can be found?</b><br />No. It won't change a thing. Because you can't change what I'm going to do. You can't make me do what I'm not going to do. But the parents can.</p>

<p><b>So then the question becomes, what is the best way to educate the parents that school in itself is a good thing -- that it's more about making money.</b><br />The parents want to teach their kids to go to school, but they're so busy trying to make money, they have no time to show their kids how to value their education.</p>

<p><b>So kids here in this area lack an example.</b><br />No example. My younger brother had a mentor-type thing, at [the University of Southern California] ... That actually helped him out a lot. And of course our experiences growing up through life, he saw what I did and said I don't want to do the same thing. He went a better route, which is pretty cool.</p>

<p><b>Is affirmative action just a Band-Aid on a huge wound?</b><br />There you go!</p>

<p><b>What if it's in conjunction with something like a mentorship program?</b><br />Yeah, OK. But still, you have to start young. Most kids are good kids in kindergarten, preschool, and then once you start getting into elementary school, that's where it goes really bad. ... We have to become tough as kids in order to be able to be OK. So it has to start young.</p>

<p><b>The most important things in terms of getting kids into college in South L.A. is mentorship, then?</b><br />Yes, at a young age. And to keep going with it throughout their young teens.</p>

<p><b>Does affirmative action have any role in that, do you think?</b><br />No, because then they still have to make a choice to either go to school and learn or not go to school and learn.</p>

<p><b>J.J. Thomas</b>, 18</p>

<p><b>Do you think race should be a factor in college acceptance decisions?</b><br />Race shouldn't mean anything. Everybody should be accepted in college, you feel me? If they're willing to get to learn, or take it to the next level to get to the big houses and to own their own businesses -- they want to make a change in the world. That's why kids want to go to college.</p>

<p><b>Well, take a place like South L.A., where there are a lot of Latinos and black people who are born into poverty, and so it's hard for parents to send their kids to college. Do you think affirmative action is a good way to try and even that playing field?</b><br />Yeah, I think it is, because if we're willing to help with businesses and stuff out here, I think they should help us in a way too ... that's their place to help us.</p>

<p><b>Whose place?</b><br />The colleges or the government. It's there place to step up, you feel me? And to see that, OK, maybe these people here in South L.A., they ain't got it all, even if their kids want to go to college, they might not have the money to go, they might not get a full-ride scholarship. Why can't the government help us? Why not? I feel it's only right, because that's what I'd do if I had the power to help other people. That's why the little change I do have, I do help people, you feel me? Because I want the return, I want the favor.</p>

<p><b>What about those who say it's not fair that minorities are given preference just because of the color of their skin?</b><br />They're selfish and they're thinking about themselves. They're not thinking about the people under them. It's just not cool. I would still like to go to a university myself. I just got out of high school, I just graduated in 2011, but I just messed up -- I chose a different route so now it's kind of hard. I want to go to a junior college and they revoked my scholarship from Arizona State University so now it's like -- what do I do now? Don't nobody want to give me no money, don't nobody want to hire me, want to help the lower, you feel me? So I've got to help myself before anything.</p>

<p><b>Actaiva C.</b>, age declined<br /><i>Actaiva declined to provide her full name or have her photo taken.</i></p>

<p><b>Do you think race should be a factor in college acceptance decisions?</b><br />It was always a factor before. … [Affirmative action] was created to level that playing field. Now I know that the playing field has been leveled to some degree -- but not enough. Because if you still look around, you'll still find there are still young people having struggles of trying to get into college. So if it was so level, then why is there still a fuss?</p>

<p><b>Take a place like South L.A.--</b><br />--or any urban communities.</p>

<p><b>--yes -- where there are a lot of Latinos and black people who are born into poverty, and so it's hard for parents to send their kids to college. Is that part of the unlevel playing field you're talking about?</b><br />Right. ... A lot of people who talk about getting rid of affirmative action, they really have nothing to offer in its place. They're talking. There's no money behind it. They just want to take it out because they think that's leveling the playing field. How are you leveling it?</p>

<p><b>Is racism behind that?</b><br />I think that people don't want to call it that, but they are prejudiced. Your child can go because you've got money, you've got all this professionalism behind you -- maybe I don't do anything but go on a menial job where I make minimum wage, and maybe that's all I can do. But I want my child to go to school. I want him to get a better education, I want him to do better now. Are you saying my child should not go because I can't afford it? Are you saying that even though they study hard, and they're working hard towards getting there, they can't go because you have these rules in place that only if you have money, [then] can you get in.</p>

<p><b>So is affirmative action a permanent solution?</b><br />I don't think anything is a permanent solution. I think that things have to revised based on the time. Here's an example: There was a couple who got married. They were young and they were having their first Thanksgiving dinner with the family and the wife says, "Go to the butcher, get me a ham and have them cut off the ends." That's the way she was going to cook it. He asked, "Why do you want the ends cut off?" She said that's the way her mother cooked it and that's the way she was going to cook it. He did that, but he came from a household where they cooked the whole ham. He couldn't understand, but he did what she said. So then, at the meal, he asked his wife's mother why they cooked the ham like that, and she said, "Well, my grandmother cooked it like that." And of course grandma was right there and he asked the grandma why she did that. And she said "Well, you see, I had a small pan and I had to cut the ends off in order to get the ham in the pan. But I used the ham hocks for the beans and the greens." She used the whole ham! But all those years, they were cutting off the rest of the ham, not because of health reasons but because the pan was too small. And they didn't know why. I think affirmative action is like that -- you have to look at why it was created in the first place and you have to revise it as you need it. It doesn't always work for every situation. ... Everything has to be taken more or less on an individual basis. But I know if there's no equal opportunity protection at the schools, students who would end up being some of the best people that you could ever find don't get that opportunity.</p>

<p><b>So affirmative action is one way to protect that.</b><br />Right. Because what else is on the books that can be enforced? Everybody can say, oh the playing field is level ... but parents who don't have [the money or connections], what are you going to do? Throw their kids away because they don't have the resources or opportunities? Every parent does not have the same opportunity as every other parent. Exposure and access is different.</p>
