        <p>Estela Abitia was a machine operator for 22 years She had steady income and life was good. But things changed when her grandson was born in 2001.</p>

<p>Her grandson Nathan was born prematurely and with complications that led a year-long hospital stay. That was when she decided to quit her job and take care of him full time.</p>

<p>“I looked over him, I taught him to read, write,” she says. “He tells me now, ‘Mama thank you for taking care of me, and being my teacher, too.’” Because of his health complications, Nathan did not go to school until the second grade. </p>

<p>While Nathan's mother worked, Estela helped him study and learn. After he was in school, she decided she could do the same for other kids and in 2002, she opened up a daycare.</p>

<p>But in order to teach better, she knew she needed to keep learning. At 56,  despite running her own business and taking care of her family, she's working to get her GED next summer. After that? A college degree.</p>

<p><strong>If you like it that much...</strong></p>

<p>Estela has been attending classes at Jefferson High Adult School since 2005.</p>

<p>“I went back to school because I like to teach, I like to take to care of kids," she said. "My teacher said that if I liked it so much I should study to become a teacher assistant.”</p>

<p>But while she decided to go to school for her GED, Estela was not ready to drop her daycare. Instead, she balanced a business and school.</p>

<p>"The kids sleep and I study," Estela said. "People ask how I have the time? I say I make time."</p>

<p>Nathan's mother and Estela's daughter, Angelica, says she's very appreciative for Estela's sacrifice and help.</p>

<p>"We totally support her and are very proud of her, she always makes sure to go [to school]," she said. "She quit her job out of the blue to look over him so I could work. You couldn't ask for a better grandma."</p>

<p>Angelica remembers her mother was never really just a "mother." Instead, Estela would always sell batteries, clothes, or jewelry to support Angelica and her brother.</p>

<p>"I never felt like we needed anything," Angelica said. "My cousins would always say, 'Oh you're so lucky I wish I had your mom,' but I didn't see it when I was younger."</p>

<p><strong>A teacher for everyone</strong></p>

<p>Since immigrating from Guatemala after an earthquake that left her family with nothing, Estela says she has worked to pay the bills and help her family. But she has found the time to help herself out as well.</p>

<p>"I decided to learn English because I was embarrassed," she said. "People in places like at the post office don't want to help you if you only speak Spanish."</p>

<p>Estela not only teaches the children at her daycare, she always helps her fellow classmates and other people around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“English is really hard, if I could help people with their ABCs I do because I know its hard. The teacher refers people to me when his class is full. I wish people could have helped me like that.”</p>

<p>Estela says many of the parents whose children she looks over come to her and ask her to fill out paperwork from school or other places in English. She says she'd rather help others learn than to translate for them.</p>

<p>While her weekdays consists of taking care of children, going to school and studying, her weekends are only vary a little. </p>

<p>"On the weekends I work and study," she said. "On Sundays I work as a gardener with my husband."</p>

<p>Estela says her husband has been without work for seven weeks, so every Sunday they both do gardening work, helps.</p>

<p>"Its hard when you own a house, you have to worry about not losing it and paying for it," she said. "But we're here, we're going, making it work."</p>

<p>While she knows some people may be discouraged to go back to school like her mother did, Angelica believes its possible.</p>

<p>"I would tell them to not have a negative mindset," "My mom still time, shes either working or doing homework. If they tell themselves that they can't do it then they don't do it."</p>

<p>Because her husband is out of work for now, Estela's daycare business is the only stable income her family has. She hopes once she gets her GED she can go on to Los Angeles City College to further her study and a better career.</p>

<p>"At another daycare they offered me a job, so I have that," she said. "But I will go to college, it will open doors for me and opportunities."</p>

<p>As far as potentially being one of the older students walking around campus, that doesn't bother Estela.</p>

<p>“Although I’m old, I can do it, I’m going to do it, if God lets me. I have nothing to lose.”</p>
