        <p>Approximately 1,200 kids a year call the nonprofit youth center on the corner of Central Avenue and 29th Street home. And if you ask Jonathan Zeichner, the executive director of the aptly-named <a href="http://www.apch.org/" target="_blank">A Place Called Home</a> (APCH), that's number's not nearly high enough.</p>

<p>Zeichner has been involved with nonprofit work in the Los Angeles area for more than two decades now, and has worked as the head of APCH for about two-and-a-half years. An artsy guy -- he has a background in filmmaking and writing -- he started out his service work doing theater programs in prisons, psychiatric wards and homeless settings. Zeichner took over APCH during a period of struggle for the organization, which had been hit hard by the financial collapse, and brought with him an infusion of new energy.  </p>

<p>When APCH started back in 1993, it was meant to be a safe haven where kids could go after school and do their homework, hang out and be with caring adults in a secure environment. Since then, the nonprofit has undergone enormous growth and has become a place where young Angelenos from the southside can become themselves. OnCentral sat with Zeichner on Tuesday morning to ask more about his work and the prospects of a better South L.A. -- especially for the kids.</p>

<p><b>OnCentral: What kind of change has APCH undergone since its beginning in 1993?</b><br />Jonathan Zeichner: Since then, the agency has developed significantly and evolved into being more than just a recreational safe haven, but really now a place that is devoted to education and development in a holistic way of the whole child, as well as working with the family and the community. So now our focus is on education, counseling, nutrition, fitness, the arts, our college preparation program, our college scholarship program and, most recently, a vocational development program.</p>

<p><b>OC: So everything.</b><br />JZ: Yeah, I mean the goal really is to find out and nourish what are the needs, what are the passions, what are the talents, what are the skills, and to provide the tools and the inspiration for young people to see themselves and take repsonsibility for becoming contributing citizens who are taking an interest in their own future but also understanding that they have an important role to play in the future and the path of their familiies and community.</p>

<p>So if you're unhappy with your surroundings and the fact that there's too much violence and crime in the neighborhood, too many liquor stores and not enough grocery stores and unemployment is high and the educational system has neglected this neighborhood in a lot of ways -- that you have to make the change, first, internally, then start externalizing that to make a difference in the community. I really believe in that. I have seen absolute miracles happen. </p>

<p>Even though you might say we're only working with 300 kids a day here, maybe 1,200 kids over the course of the year -- that may seem like a small number, but when you extrapolate that over what the impact will be when they get a high school diploma and a college education, then they get a job, then they learn about volunteerism ... that actually has a huge impact.</p>

<p><b>OC: Let's talk about this area's prospects. Growing up in this area, what do kids experience without a place like APCH?</b><br />JZ: A study recently released from the <a href="http://v3.advancementprojectca.org/" target="_blank">Advancement Project</a> shows that about 90 percent of the young people we're working with here have witnessed or been directly impacted by felony-level violence. Ninety percent. Generally, that doesn't mean a one-time occurrence -- they have witnessed shootings. They have had someone in their family either be a victim or be a perpetrator of violence. They have an older brother or a parent who is in a gang or is incarcerated. They've walked across a body on the way to school. These are the things our kids experience.</p>

<p>They're incredibly resilient. They have to be. Because you have to walk carrying some sort of a forcefield with you, I think, to just go through your normal day here in this neighborhood. And that's not to say that's all that happens in this neighborhood -- it's not. There's a lot about this neighborhood to feel great about. But it's dangerous.</p>

<p><b>OC: And that's big. If you think about the number of kids APCH is able to take in, there's a cap, as with any nonprofit. Is that ever overwhelming to you?</b><br />JZ: Yes, on two levels. How do we reach more kids, and how do we have them for more time? Because three-and-a-half, four hours a day is not enough. The next day they're going back to, oftentimes, broken schools, and being exposed to a different set of dynamics and values than we have here at APCH. So we are looking at expansion.  That's something that's very real for us, and this year we'll be making some decisions about our capacity to serve more kids, growing our teen program in particular. And we're also looking at the possibility of creating a school. </p>

<p>It is a constant -- I don't want to say it's a frustration, but there's always the feeling that it's not enough. That we could be doing more, that we should be doing more. The need is greater than what we're able to serve. You have to make peace with that in nonprofit [work], on some level. </p>

<p><b>OC: How do you do that?</b><br />JZ: First of all, the fact that you choose a <a href="http://www.apch.org/about.php" target="_blank">mission</a> -- you'll never be done with it. You're constantly going to be working it to provide an alternative to all the negative possibilities that exist out there for kids and families. And that "good and bad," in very broad terms, will always coexist, and always has and I think it always will. So you can't lose hope on that. You just have to keep going and invest in the aspects you believe in and that you know are making a difference. </p>

<p>It's that old story about the evil wolf and the good wolf -- which one is going to win the battle? The one that you feed. And I think that's what APCH does every day and does really well -- is feed the best in each of us, recognizing that we're not going to be able to fix everything but that we're making a difference.</p>

<p><b>OC: Have you ever come close to throwing your hands up and losing hope?</b><br />JZ: Well, I'll tell you when I get most discouraged is when a young person who's been working hard and who you've been working with loses their way, whether that's because they get involved in a criminal enterprise or they get caught up in a peer-pressure situation that puts them somewhere they really shouldn't be, or sometimes because they're a victim. We've had young people here who we love dearly who have been injured or even killed.</p>

<p><b>OC: You talk about seeing miracles. How do people know that's not just another nonprofit tagline?</b><br />JZ: I think one thing is anything can happen at APCH. I'm excited to be here, and one of the reasons is I know that whether it's a play reading by known actors, which happened yesterday; whether we have a musician here from Somalia who's going into our recording studio and sit with our kids and talk about his life and being a refugee and coming to this country to use his artistry to sing about peace and love and people getting together and making a difference; whether it's a kid being introduced to new food and planting a seed in the <a href="../../23/place-called-home-every-home-needs-garden/index.html" target="_blank">garden</a> -- those are the kinds of miracles I'm talking about. They come sometimes in very small packages, but they change lives. </p>

<p>And that to me is the miracle -- every day is a day when you could possibly make a new choice about what you're going to do with your life. You could make a new friend. You could learn a fact that changes your whole idea about the world. More than anything, the goal here is for kids to feel a sense of empowerment and responsibility and membership in this community that we have, but also in the greater community. That is the miracle, when human beings decide they're going to connect and change things. </p>

<p>There are other kinds of miracles. We lost funding recently from the community redevelopment agencies, as did many, many others when they were dismantled across the state -- and a week later, Coldplay did a <a href="../../../01/30/coldplay-perform-benefit-concert-two-local-non-pro/index.html" target="_blank">benefit concert</a> for us and raised back more than two-thirds of the funds that we had just lost. So there is a certain leap of faith involved in running a nonprofit. There's going to be struggle, there's going to be challenge, but oftentimes they come hand-in-hand with a gift or a blessing that you didn't expect.</p>

<p><b>OC: What draws you to this kind of work? In all the work you've done, is there a drawing factor that has remained consistent throughout it all?</b><br />JZ: Some of it's very simple: wanting to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. And that's a very simplistic way of putting it, but honestly,  every day I feel like I have an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of the hundreds of kids we work with here and in the staff -- because I work for my staff. I always say that; I'm the head servant. ... so I have a sense of purpose. My mother always said make yourself useful, and that is a big deal for me, to feel useful every day.</p>

<p>But beyond that, look around at what's happening with the world. All of us are so inundated every single day with bad news -- stories about people being cruel to each other, greedy, imposing their will through force on others, war and the kinds of political, ideological battles that we see waged in headlines -- to be able to come to a place every day where the invitation is to find a way to do something good, that's a great blessing. I feel like I have the best job in the world. Sometimes I miss being a writer. Just being able to make up whole worlds out of thin air was thrilling and compelling and exciting. But being able to really connect with real people every day turns out to be even more fulfilling.</p>

<p><b>OC: I was wondering if you were going to connect creating whole new worlds on paper with creating whole new worlds for these kids.</b><br />JZ: [Laughs] Yeah, exactly. ... It may not be about being rich and famous, but being rich in terms of purpose and meaning and feeling like you're in the right place at the right time. That's how I feel here. So I'm very grateful.</p>

<p><b>OC: When you talk about wanting to be part of the solution, what's the solution for a place with the challenges of South L.A.?</b><br />JZ: There are many different ways to approach the problems and challenges that exist here in South L.A.. There are some really basic core values that I have and that exist here at APCH, and it goes back to love, people respecting and honoring and wishing the best for each other and taking real actions to follow through on that.</p>

<p><b>OC: Is there a shortage of that in South L.A. culture?</b><br />JZ: I think there's a shortage -- I think that people are stuck inside themselves. I think people are afraid, and that they are protecting or they feel like they're protecting themselves, and that in order to do that, they have to withhold connection and emotional availability. So they walk around -- a lot of us do -- feeling defensive. The world becomes like a big video game and other human beings are obstacles between you and what it is you're trying to get. So there's a competitive quality and with kids, there's this perceived need to be cool and not to be affected by things, not to have feelings and in fact, the opposite is what is needed, for people to really see each other. To open their hearts and see themselves as human beings.</p>

<p><b>OC: So the people of South L.A. needs to be more vulnerable.</b><br />JZ: I think on some level everybody would benefit if we could just see each other as human beings, and not obstacles or adversaries. And that's one thing, on a very deep level, so how do you get there? Well APCH tries to create an atmostphere where it's safe to be your full self, however you're feeling that day. And it's not always that you're feeling good and happy and generous -- but this is a safe place to come and be who you really are and expres your needs, and also give what you have to give. So I think on a very deep, core level, South L.A., L.A. proper, the world needs people to let down their defenses and get more in touch with what their human potential is and what their potential for connection is.</p>

<p><b>OC: In terms of reaching a better South L.A., who do you think is doing the most right now?</b><br />JZ: What I would like to see is more partnership and more unified understanding and methodology and approaches. I think everybody has a part to play in that -- nonprofits have a huge role. The police department, the mayor, the City Council office, foundations, private enterprise -- everybody can make a difference in South L.A.. And people are. I see it all the time ... where organizations, nonprofits, business owners, elected officials are all trying to do the right thing and make a difference. </p>

<p>I think the paradox that we live with in a place like South L.A. is that there are lots of great things happening and lots of not-so-great things happening at the same time. And as I said earlier, it's life. I don't think that we're ever going to overcome and eliminate all of the obstacles and the bad things that exist in this neighborhood, but I think what we are going to do is help young people figure out how they're going to respond and what are their lives going to be like, how are they going to make change and take responsibility and ownership and authorship of their own lives. That's as much as I think we can do on that level. On a broader community level, we can be exemplars and invite everybody out there to join us and make more partnerships to make a difference and provide a safety net and more opportunity. And we're doing that all the time. ... helping kids discover their own possibilities and then develop the tools or the skills to realize them. That's what's going to make a difference.</p>

<p><b>OC: And are you hopeful?</b><br />JZ: I'm always hopeful. I come here every day believing that today is the day when something great is going to happen and we're going to make a difference and some kid is going to have a revelation that will change everything for them and for the people that they interact with. So I'm constantly hopeful about the individuals we work with, and I see a lot of great things happening in South Central and South L.A..</p>
