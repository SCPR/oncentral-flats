        <p>Jan Perry, councilwoman for the Vernon Central and part of Downtown Los Angeles, has officially filed paperwork to throw her hat in the ring for the 2013 mayoral race.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, radio talk show host <a href=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/03/talk-radio-host-kevin-james-announces-run-for-mayor.html">Kevin James</a> announced his intent to run. The race is becoming crowded, with at least <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/05/local/la-me-0227-mayor-20110227">seven potential candidates</a> vying for Antonio Villaraigosa's seat.</p>

<p>Perry, who has been serving downtown L.A. and Vernon Central since 2001, said her work in South Los Angeles has influenced her hopes for the city as a whole. </p>

<p>“It has served as part of a larger agenda,” Perry said. “It has set the tone to help the community have a pathway to recovery through local transportation, housing and jobs... that’s what helps me shape my vision of what I can do for the city.”</p>

<p>Perry currently serves as the President Pro Tempore of the city council and is the chair of the Energy and Environment Committee. She is ineligible to run for re-election as a councilwoman after her current term ends in 2013.</p>

<p>Perry said she still has plenty of items on her to-do list before she leaves office. She said she hopes redevelopment of the historic Dunbar Hotel will be completed, as well as the wetland project on Avalon and 54th Streets.</p>

<p>She also has several projects in downtown to complete: additional developments to the Figueroa campus that includes LA Live and the Convention Center and redeveloping Grand Avenue — part of which is the Broad Museum, a contemporary art museum — that could create more than 100 permanent jobs.</p>

        <p>YJ Draiman files papers running for Mayor of Los Angeles - 2013</p>

<p>Motivated by the desire to serve the Los Angeles community and to hold City Hall accountable for it’s actions, I have decided the best way to accomplish my goal is to run for and become the next Mayor of Los Angeles As Mayor, it would be my duty and goal to not just protect the quality of life in Los Angeles, but to improve it.  More importantly, as Mayor I intend to protect and improve the quality of life for ALL the people of Los Angeles, not just a select few. <br /> <br />The most consistent complaint I heard from some residents of Los Angeles when I ran for City Council was that no one knows what City Hall is doing anymore. The good of the common people seems to have been lost in the process.  City Hall has become self-serving with little or no accountability, which is why I have adopted and will instill a policy of &quot;transparency and accountability&quot; in City Hall.  A government &quot;for the people&quot; must be held accountable by the people.  <br /> <br />One of my biggest goals would be to make City Hall account for every single cent spent. Some of my more specific goals are balancing the budget, encouraging economic vitality, preserving and improving the City infrastructure, protecting the quality of our neighborhoods, supporting our open space and bicycle trails programs, working with the Neighborhood Councils and the Chamber to encourage local, innovative green businesses, and proper Urban Planning for Los Angeles, among others.<br /> <br />Without question some will raise the issue of my not being a politician.   Quite honestly, I am proud not to be another well-polished, slick-oiled career politician.  At this junction of difficult times for most, I do not believe the people of Los Angeles would best be served by yet another politician.  What is needed is a Mayor who truly understands the needs of the common people.  What is needed is a Mayor willing to put City Hall in a glass building for all to watch while working diligently to serve the interests of the common people and not just the interests of a select few.<br /> <br />While I am not a politician, I am proud to state I am a family man. I am married to a darling wife for over 40 years, we have two grown children – my oldest son is David Draiman a famous Rock Star with a Band by the name Disturbed, my younger son Benjamin Draiman is a Psychologist doing research and playing music.</p>

<p>Current Elected Member of the Northridge East Community Council </p>

<p>I am currently working on my PHD in Energy Conservation.</p>

<p>A dedicated family man with an extensive business background including but not limited to mechanical engineer, healthcare administrator, real estate developer with neighborhood gentrification, project manager of a major 5 star hotel construction,  operator of a chain of retail electronic stores, energy efficiency.  </p>

<p>“Transparency and accountability is my motto”</p>

        <p>Do we need an ethical bailout to go along with the financial one?</p>

<p>Let us discuss the need for honesty and integrity as the basic principle of leadership. Defines quality leadership as a process beyond technical competence. Successful leaders continually demonstrate honesty and integrity as an essential element of their professional fabric; a lack of commitment to the principle renders all other skills meaningless. Depicts honesty and integrity as essential elements of human behavior that promote and support quality relationships. Defines honesty and integrity in the context of building trust and maintaining credibility. Provides a sound philosophy that increases the probability for long-term success and professional fulfillment.<br />The matter raised &quot;legitimate and genuine concerns&quot;, adding: &quot;My concern ... is that without integrity and legitimacy and honesty, and then Government cannot function. This must now be settled, otherwise it saps at the very heart of what is the highest office – and the highest office-holder.&quot;</p>

<p>Is honesty for suckers?</p>

<p>— A worldwide recession sets in when it turns out that a vast subprime mortgage system was built on a foundation of fraud.<br />— Government officials are convicted of fraud and misappropriation of funds and backdoor deals.<br />— Cheating is rampant in high schools and colleges. </p>

<p>— And in sports? The same deal. Doping scandals, cheating, chemical and otherwise, pervades football, baseball and other sports. <br />— Wall Street is being manipulated by corporate America bilking investors out of billions of dollars.</p>

<p>If so many people are cheating, how can honest people play by the rules and not be at a disadvantage — in school, at work, in sports, in business? </p>

<p>Do we need an ethical bailout to go along with the financial one?</p>

<p>Are you a chump if you play by the rules? </p>

        <p>Pension crisis<br />I do not think that any elected officials have a viable solution to the pension deficit issue which will continue to grow.<br />As I said before there is no simple solution. This is an issue that affects every level of government (City, County, State, Federal, Etc.). No one solution or one individual can solve this problem. It would take a committee with multitude of financial planners and an open mind to modify the plan as it progresses, when some facets of the plan do not work as anticipated.<br />But as the crisis grows, we as people of this great country must put our differences aside and work for the common goals and restore our City, State and the Nation to the spirit of our founding fathers.<br />I think that every politician or candidate should state what they propose to do to correct the situation and not attack their opponent or the opposition.<br />Tell me and or show me what you can do, not what the other did not do or did wrong.<br />Action speaks louder than words.<br />We need to remain vigilant, especially as the City of Los Angeles is facing a monumental fiscal crisis.<br />Public confidence in the integrity of the Government is indispensable to faith in democracy; and when we lose faith in the system, we have lost faith in everything we fight and spend for.<br />Thank you<br />YJ Draiman for Mayor of Los Angeles<br /></p>

<p>I believe that if people know the rules and are sensitized by art, humor, and creativity, they are more likely to accept change.<br />The crucial point of a citizens&#39; culture is learning to correct others without mistreating them or generating aggression. We need to create a society in which civility rules over cynicism and apathy.</p>
