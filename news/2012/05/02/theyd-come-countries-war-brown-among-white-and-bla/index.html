        <p><i>This is third in a series of Q&As with members of the South L.A. community about the <a href="../../../04/29/shattering-south-la-20-years-after-riots/index.html" target="_blank">riots of 1992</a>.</i></p>

<p>Rubén Martínez knew the '92 L.A. riots were going to be big when his truck was set on fire near the intersection of Adams and Crenshaw boulevards.</p>

<p>He was a 29-year-old journalist when the riots broke out, reporting for L.A. Weekly, Pacific News Service and NPR, and working as one of three hosts for Life and Times, a local politics and culture TV series that also featured KPCC's own <a href="http://www.scpr.org/programs/patt-morrison/" target="_blank">Patt Morrison</a> as a host. That was his "most visible" role, he said, adding that his job at Life and Times had started just about two weeks before the riots broke out.</p>

<p>Martínez's current profession involves fewer cars-on-fire – he's now the Fletcher Jones Chair in Literature and Writing in the Department of English at Loyola Marymount University. That's far cry from the chaos of the South L.A. riots – or El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, where Martínez used to be a war journalist.</p>

<p>The professor had also published his first book "right around" the time the verdict was announced in the Rodney King case.</p>

<p>"My career was kind of congealing," he said. "I got a lot of attention. I was in limousines all the time, going to CNN's studios. They would pick me up and take me to CNN, Ted Koppel, ABC, Nightline, Frontline on PBS."</p>

<p>He'd been a reporter for six years, and now as the riots broke out, he'd become a spokesperson, he says – "a spokesperson for brown people." The black and white racial element of the riots is nearly always at the forefront of the public perception of what began on April 29, 1992, but among the black and the white, Martínez says, there was the brown – Latinos, and mostly immigrants.</p>

<p>After all, it is Los Ángeles.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>How was it that you came to be the "spokesperson for brown people?"</b><br />One of the big questions about the riots that was asked almost immediately was why did brown people riot? And why were ultimately more Latinos arrested than African-Americans?</p>

<p>Most of the violence was in the Pico-Union neighborhood, for Latinos. And that was almost exclusively Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrants. And in South L.A. as well, there were pockets of violence among Latinos and that was almost exclusively Mexican and Central American immigrants. Mexican-Americans weren't involved. Almost zero. There was nothing going on Boyle Heights. Nothing going on in Highland Park.</p>

<p><b>What was it about immigrants?</b><br />The pressure in the immigrant neighborhoods was a whole different kind – the poverty in immigrant neighborhoods and the relationship with the police was very particular. And it was right alongside African-Americans. In the historic Mexican-American corridors on the eastside, with very low African-American population – from Pico-Union south to Watts and whiter South L.A – the immigrants were living alongside African-Americans. </p>

<p>And I think they were influenced by African-Americans in many ways. They were influenced in terms of popular culture, kids were growing up with hip-hop. First-generation kids, kids who had come with their parents from El Salvador, as refugees from Guatemala – they'd come from countries of war, they'd come from countries where they'd experienced violence firsthand, and a very particular kind of violence: government soldiers and police repressing civilian population.</p>

<p>You could switch that out for the LAPD and the experience wasn't that different.</p>

<p><b>So the LAPD was abusing these immigrants?</b><br />Oh, absolutely. Look at the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/lapd/scandal/" target="_blank">Rampart Scandal</a>. I still sense that Rampart was the tip of the iceberg, because most people who were physically abused or extorted or threatened, harmed physically, emotionally, whatever – I think the vast majority of that is undocumented. I hate to use that term; the pun is unintended. Most of those cases have not been documented precisely because undocumented immigrants are by definition vulnerable and underreport crime.</p>

<p><b>On the day the riots began, where were you?</b><br />At the courthouse. I remember it was a very motley crew. It was just this grab-bag of lunatics and activists and cops and reporters. Lot of reporters who'd been hanging out for weeks during the trial – old, jaded local TV news reporters. </p>

<p>On the other hand, activists – and then just, like, crazy people. People who thought they were Old Testament prophets. There was this guy with an old conch, dressed in white robes, and he was saying, "Repent, the end of the world is near." And it was really eerie because when the verdict happened he was saying, "The wrath of God will come now." And it came. </p>

<p><b>And when the jury found those officers not guilty, what was your reaction?</b><br />I remember one of the African-American activists saying, really loudly, over and over again, "Burn, baby, burn. Burn, baby, burn." </p>

<p>And we all just kind of looked at each other and said, "Let's go to First AME Church in Crenshaw area." At the time, the pastor was Rev. Cecil Murray. We needed to go down there to see what the community leaders were going to say. But the sense was that the powder keg was about to explode.</p>

<p><b>Had that powder keg been that way for the entire trial?</b><br />Oh, it'd been that way since the video was released. There was tremendous tension. And it pre-dates Rodney King. I did a lot of coverage in the housing projects in South L.A. – Nickerson Gardens, Jordan Downs – I mean, allegations of police abuse were just rampant. You heard about it all the time. But it hardly registered at all in the L.A. Times, in the mainstream news. But in the neighborhoods, the number-one issue, besides poverty, was an antagonistic relationship with the LAPD, symbolized by [then-Police Chief] Daryl Gates.</p>

<p><b>So why did people snap on that day? What was it about Rodney King?</b> <br />Video doesn't lie. It was the video. If there had been a video before Rodney King, it would have happened then. But a democratization of media, to an extent enabled by popular video camcorders, putting that in the hands of everyday people – today we pull out our iPhones and everybody covers everything, right? This was the beginning of that era.</p>

<p>I remember there was a case – the <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/2002-09-12/news/the-bum-blockade-zoot-suit-riot-and-bloody-christmas/" target="_blank">Eula Love case</a> – she was killed by LAPD officers in the 1970s, witnessed by a lot of people, and it was like a rallying cry for a lot of people, but it was concentrated in South Los Angeles, in that neighborhood, with those activists – and it didn't resonate beyond that. It was easy to control and contain. It was easy for the city as a whole to ignore it. The reverberations, in other words, were localized. </p>

<p>With the Rodney King video that everybody looked at – it comes down to video doesn't lie, as reductionist as that sounds. But without that video, who knows when things would have blown. But it was because of that, and a verdict seemingly saying that black is white or white is black – total Orwellian verdict. Everybody can see the video, and then an all-white jury says the opposite. It was just so in your face.</p>

<p><b>LAPD Southeast Division Capt. Phil Tingirides <a href="../../../04/30/remembering-riots-places-were-gutted-everywhere/index.html" target="_blank">explained</a> that the officers involved with the case didn't have a whole lot of options when it came to subduing Rodney King. You were a spokesman for this community – what would their reaction have been to an explanation like his?</b><br />[Pause] The way the law is applied, the way the law had historically been applied in Los Angeles against black and brown people, the LAPD wasn't a police force. It was an occupying army that had zero credibility. And I mean zero.</p>

<p><b>You mean with minorities?</b><br />Yes, with African-Americans and Latinos in general. I mean, you could get a couple of pro-LAPD voices if you looked really hard, but the vast majority – I mean, people would get tickets for jaywalking all the time in Pico-Union. I'm Salvadoran, so that's where I hung out. And people would say all the time, "I got a f****** ticket today. For crossing the street." And it was just the LAPD's way of saying, "Hey, we're in charge here." There was nothing you could do to avoid the wrath of the LAPD.</p>

<p><b>And what was the demographic, generally speaking, of the LAPD at the time?</b><br />Much less Latino than it is today, that's for sure. [Laughs] And a disproportionate number of cops lived in the suburbs. It was a lot whiter than it is today, and the white cops lived in places like Simi Valley.</p>

<p><b>So the "'hood," so to speak, was a place the cops came to and left every day.</b><br />Exactly. This is long before the idea of community-based policing.</p>

<p><b>So the verdict's given – when do you realize this is going to become the L.A. riots?</b><br />When my truck is on fire on Adams near Crenshaw. I'd had to park my car several blocks away from First AME and we had already been hearing about something happening at Florence and Normandie. There were sporadic reports, but we didn't have iPhones then, so I was just hearing bits and pieces of stuff. So while we were at First AME listening to then-Mayor Tom Bradley, pleading for calm, pleading that we let the judicial process take care of this, there were people just whistling and cat-calling and saying, "Forget you, man! This is crazy. We're not going to keep calm." It was already in the air.</p>

<p>When we left, there was stuff on fire. Walk out the church, you could smell the smoke. Walk down the street, my car's in flames because it happened to be in front of a building that was looted and torched. And from that point on, it was just the next five days, more or less.</p>

<p><b>What kinds of things were you doing as a journalist?</b><br />I didn't sleep for four days. We just went wherever there was looting. The second day is when the immigrant 'hoods went up – that didn't happen the first night. The first night was primarily African-Americans.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>Is there an image that you think of when you think of the riots?</b><br />There's so much. For me, because I had spent years covering the Central American neighborhoods – I remember standing on the corner of 7th and Pico; there's this place called Union Swapmeet – huge, beautiful, ornate building, wonderful cornices and details. It was a beehive of activity – Korean shop owners, <i>curanderos</i>, drug dealers, <i>cumbía</i> music, papusas. It was like seven or eight stories high – massive building. It was one of the big hubs of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan neighborhoods. </p>

<p>We saw a big column of smoke rising – "we" being [photographer] <a href="http://www.tedsoquiphoto.com/" target="_blank">Ted Soqui</a> and myself –  and we go up to it and it's the Union Swapmeet. And that's when I said, "Man, this is not just a black thing anymore; this is a black and brown thing."</p>

<p><b>Why did it become a brown thing?</b><br />Because Central American immigrants had it hard. They came from war – death squads, corrupt and murderous police and soldiers – and they came into the hardest neighborhoods in Los Angeles where the LAPD was basically playing the same role that government forces had in their own countries. </p>

<p>And they were poor. It's not like they found the American Dream when they came up here. Los Angeles was in a deep, deep, deep recession. The worst economic crisis before the one we just went through. Pico-Union was the densest census tract in the United States at the time. I mean, people were just jammed together. I'm talking South Bronx, 1980s poverty. The worst of American urban poverty. That was Pico-Union in the '90s, and that's why Pico-Union went up.</p>

<p>People were desperate. I call them bread riots. Some people call them Pampers riots. Because that was one of the most popular things to steal during the riots. Pampers. Food and diapers for your kids.</p>

<p><b>Give us a profile of a typical looter that you saw.</b><br />I saw moms carting off Pampers. I saw some electronic stuff, too. I wanted some of that electronic stuff! But more than that, I saw people with food, saw people with alcohol – a lot of people with furniture. Furniture stores were very popular. And you look at the electronics and say, oh, that's just people trying to get in on the chaos and spoil themselves with the loot. </p>

<p>The furniture was something else, though. You're talking about families jammed into one-bedroom apartments, sleeping on the floor. These living conditions were extreme. So when you saw people taking a sofa bed or something like that, to some people, it could seem like some horribly immoral thing. I saw a family and imagined their saying, "Wouldn't it be nice to have a sofa bed in the living room so my uncle doesn't have to sleep on the floor with the cockroaches?" So I saw some looting that was definitely just people going out for themselves, and I saw a lot of other looting that was people getting their basic needs met.</p>

<p><b>Did you ever have conversations with looters?</b><br />I remember specifically talking to mothers, women. That's the other thing – the media image was a bunch of guys at Circuit City. And I'm talking to twenty-something Salvadoran mothers. And they're saying things like, "I have to do this. This is my family at stake. If I don't do this, I'm failing my family. I'm risking my life, I'm risking arrest, I'm risking deportation – but if I don't, my kid's going to be [sh****** himself] and he's not going to have anything to eat tonight." Desperation. That would have to have been probably what I came across most, fear and desperation.</p>

<p><b>What was it like being a journalist covering the riots? Were you scared?</b><br />No. That was afterward. And I had already been a war journalist in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala for years before this. I'd been in the mountains with guerilla fighters; I'd been in helicopters with soldiers shooting at people on the ground. I'd seen a lot. And I think that entire time I was running on adrenaline. War reporters will often talk about how adrenaline shuts off fear. Otherwise, there wouldn't be war reporters. And it's kind of a rush, in a sick kind of way.</p>

<p><b>And when the adrenaline subsided?</b><br />Oh, man. I think I still suffer from it today. It's like post-traumatic stuff. When the adrenaline ran out, it was like panic – "Oh my God, what did I just do? What did I just see? Did I just see what I think I saw?" </p>

<p><b>Was it surreal, looking back?</b><br />You know, that was my reality. I wouldn't say I ever thought, "Oh my God, I can't believe this is happening," except for this weird sensation: I had been reporting on violence in Central America and all of sudden it was in L.A. – and it was as if the violence in Central America had swept up into L.A., somehow. There was this eeriness – was it following me? There were times when I would hear helicopters overhead and I would have flashbacks to El Salvador, because helicopters were used a lot during the war there.</p>

<p>It was a very haunted kind of feeling. I lived that for many, many years. And I think I still carry it with me today. There's a war going on now in Mexico and I'm writing about it a lot, and I'm organizing on it, but it's not the kind of war you can cover, number one, and even if it was, I don't think I'd be there. Twenty years later, it's like I have enough ghosts, you know? I also have two young daughters. I wasn't married and didn't have kids then. That might have made a difference.</p>

<p><b>Did you have any close calls in '92?</b><br />This was the only close call – the first night of the riots, I was with <a href="http://www.scpr.org/programs/offramp/2012/04/24/26118/historian-joe-domanick-the-lapds-culpability-in-th" target="_blank">Joe Domanick</a>, a really, really good reporter who ended up writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/To-Protect-Serve-Century-Dreams/dp/0972762558" target="_blank">"To Protect and to Serve."</a> That book is known as the definitive history of the LAPD. He and I were together downtown as the violence was kicking up. And we were walking down the street together – he's a white guy – and this pickup truck with black dudes rolls past and they've got assault rifles; they're just armed to the teeth. It looks like a commando jeep in a war-torn country. </p>

<p>And they slow down when they see him. And I'm standing next to him, so I would have been collateral damage. They slow down, and say, "What the f*** you doing here, honkey-ass?" Something like that. He said, "We're journalists, man, we're journalists," and I said, "Yeah, we're journalists!" And we had our press passes out. And they said, "F*** you all," and they just kept on going. It's like they were out hunting.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>What did the '92 riots do to South L.A.?</b><br />It's complicated. I mean, on the one hand, a lot of money came in. Same thing happened after the riots in the '60s. Stage a riot in the United States in the latter part of the 20th century, that might get you some public works money. So there were physical improvements. Small-business start-ups. Small business support. And community-based organizations that got a lot of money from foundations.</p>

<p><b>Was it too little too late?</b><br />No. This had a direct impact on people's lives. Everything from daycare-type stuff to outreach to immigrant families to food programs – it was real. It dissipated after a while, and I think one of the main things was, everything from Pico-Union going south – when you go down there today, there are still food deserts. There's still red-lining in terms of banks. There's still a surplus of liquor stores. There's still higher unemployment there, higher poverty than the rest of the city. The demographic has changed; it's much more brown today than it is black. The political representation of the city has changed; we elected the first mayor of Mexican descent in 150 years [Antonio Villaraigosa]. The political class changed, but the overall economy, I don't think, was fundamentally altered.</p>

<p>The relationship with the LAPD was altered. I think one of the big results of the riots was the investigation of Rampart wouldn't have happened if not for the riots. The demographic of the LAPD is fundamentally transformed; community-based policing begins. Darryl Gates leaves and Willie Williams comes in. First non-white police chief, followed by Bernard Parks [who is also black], so it's like – demographics shifted and the color of the political class shifted, and there was short- to mid-term investment, but a lot of the socioeconomic challenges that existed before the riots exist today.</p>

<p><b>Is it in a better place?</b><br />Only slightly, because of the relationship with the LAPD being different, being better. Today it's much harder for there to be a completely rogue cop. Back then, there would be no investigation. They would just circle the wagons. That kind of impunity doesn't exist anymore. And that's a big deal.</p>

<p>And ultimately if that's the biggest thing that the riots got, that's a pretty big thing.</p>

<p>I think also the Latino city really started to come of age. There's still a disconnect between the immigrant city and the Mexican-American city, to this day, but at least Pico-Union has political representation. </p>

<p><b>In light of situations like the one with <a href="http://www.oncentral.org/news/2012/03/27/oncentral-foot-wearing-hoodie/" target="_blank">Trayvon Martin</a>, <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2012/04/05/31913/several-twists-and-turns-police-shooting-kendrec-m/' target="_blank">Kendrec McDade</a>, how easy would it be for another riot to happen?</b><br />Toward the end of summer 1991, I wrote a column for the L.A. Weekly that said there would be a long, hot summer the following year if something didn't change in terms of the community's relationship with the LAPD. It was just in the air. The Rodney King video had already aired – anyone who had eyes could see where this was headed. It was obvious. And people who didn't know it was going to happen were just, I'm sorry – they had their head in the sand. I don't think it took a lot of intelligence to predict the riots.</p>

<p>Today, it's not in the air the same way. Not in Los Angeles, not right now.</p>

<p><b>What's different?</b><br />Barack Obama's in the White House; Villaraigosa's in the mayor's office; the political class is less antagonistic and has a different color, and that symbolism counts for a lot. Most Latinos in the country are going to vote for Barack Obama again, despite the fact that he hasn't come through on his promises on immigration reform, because they think his heart's in the right place, he's trying to do it, and maybe he'll do it the second term.</p>

<p>He's not white. He's not Daryl Gates. He's not George H.W. Bush. Back then, there was a recession, a white conservative political class, a brutal LAPD. It was just textbook.</p>

<p>Today, Los Angeles is a progressive city, and the relationship with the LAPD is different. And there's plenty of places where the steam valve releases pressure.</p>

<p><b>But in '92, all those steam valves were closed.</b><br />Exactly. There was no other place for it to go. So I don't think we're on the verge of anything like that. But if this recession double dips, and President Romney comes in and somehow Rick Caruso gets mayor – you can start lining up a bunch of things and move the chess board around a little bit. It wouldn't take too much to put everything back in place. I mean, especially the economy. Unemployment and the poverty rate now is higher than it was back then. So that's still here. </p>

<p>But I think you need a little bit more than that, you need a lot of other things lined up, for the powder keg to blow.</p>
