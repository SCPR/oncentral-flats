        <p>Anyone who wandered onto the top level of the Newton police station's parking structure on Saturday morning might have been startled to see local youth taking swing after swing at police officers and each other.</p>

<p>It wasn't a rumble, though, and it had the full endorsement of every officer there: It was part of Newton's new<a href="http://www.lapdnewtonpal.com/" target="_blank">Police Activity League</a> (PAL), a youth crime prevention program that offers athletic, recreational and educational activities to local kids to keep them off the streets and in a positive, constructive environment. Saturday morning's activity was boxing.</p>

<p>Officer Daniel Calderon, who's in his 27th year in the Los Angeles Police Department, is a facilitator for Newton's PAL, and described the kids in the program as "in jeopardy." </p>

<p>"They come in and their parents are just kind of in the shadows," he said. "We're talking ages eight to 17." </p>

<p>Calderon explained that the idea is for PAL kids to eventually join the LAPD's <a href="http://www.lapdcadets.com/" target="_blank">cadet program</a>, which offers lessons in life skills to youth under the mentoring and guidance of law enforcement officers. PAL is a stepping stone on that path, but Newton's PAL program, which began just months ago, has few resources and is already over 60 members strong -- and growing.</p>

<p>"If you were to tour the LAPD and check out their PALs, I would bet you anything that we are the totally low-budget group out of all of them," said Calderon. "Yet that is the greatest opportunity for us to resourceful." </p>

<p>That's especially crucial, Calderon said, because there's a dire shortage of healthy, safe and legal activities in the area to keep kids busy.</p>

<p>That resourcefulness is why the PAL kids and a smattering of cadets were practicing boxing techniques and running through conditioning workouts in Newton station's parking lot on Saturday, under the direction of Robert Sale. Sale, who was an amateur boxer as a child, went pro at 18 and is now a trainer who counts professional and amateur fighters (and LAPD officers, cadets and PAL kids) among his students.</p>

<p> "This sport has always –- always -- presented a way out, and not just on a competitive level," said Sale. Every so often he would stop his interview to yell at the PAL kids: "This is a game of discipline!" Or, "I must be a great teacher because you're looking really good out here!"</p>

<p>"This sport represents the lower socioeconomic community, like in this area, and is an opportunity to teach self-discipline, self-worth, respect for the community, respect for themselves," he continued. "Plus it's a great way to vent frustration. It's a great form of exercise. Historically, this sport always thrives in lower socioeconomic stratified communities. It's always been that way."</p>

<p>Another glance at the cadets, whom Sale can hear complaining about the heat: "What's everybody crying about, the sun?" he yelled. "God gave us the sun! It's good for you! Look, you want to play golf, you go play golf." PAL kids and cadets alike jump to attention when Sale instructs, but also smile at his witty trainer banter.</p>

<p>Brandy Garcia has been in the PAL program for about three weeks and boxing for the same amount of time. "I like it. I want to be a boxer," she said, "so this gives me an experience of how it's going to be. That's why I do it." Garcia also echoed Calderon's point about the lack of extracurriculars in the area. "If it weren't for this, I'd probably be home watching TV and doing things that aren't right," she said. "There are a lot of kids that do that in this area."</p>

<p>George Ayvar, who's been a cadet for two years and often helps out with PAL activities, said the program takes kids off the streets. "In this area, the kids adapt to their surroundings. They're troublemakers," he said. "It's just a bad area for little kids, and this is one of the few programs for them."</p>

<p>When asked where he'd be without the cadet program, Ayvar, 17, laughed. "Getting in trouble. I don't know what I'd be doing -- maybe join a gang. My neighborhood is full of them."</p>

<p>As Calderon watched the PAL kids practice jabs and hooks and defensive techniques -- and then practice them again -- he said the economics of the area make it a struggle to keep PAL going. "There are other PAL places in L.A. that have their own karate dojo or gyms, but those are more affluent communities. We're not," he said. "Look around -- everybody's struggling. There are a lot of businesses and they don't have money to spare to help our their local PAL. So we get what we can get."</p>

<p>Calderon said Sale was right to call this a "way out" for the kids. </p>

<p>"All of them need a way out. Because they're all living in Newton division. And Newton division is just chock-full of gangsters and junk. Every block has a damn gang. They're really horrible. A lot of these kids never get out of their neighborhoods. It's sit around and watch TV. It's PlayStation. It's Mom doesn't have time for me, Dad doesn't have time for me because Mom and Dad are working." </p>

<p>Despite the area's problems with gangs, violence and drugs, Calderon remains optimistic. "I think PAL, for us, is just a baby right now, and what we've got going can go nowhere but up," he said. "There's no guarantee that this is going to work, but it's a shot. I'm very optimistic about them."</p>

<p>People like Maria Soberano, 21, may be part of the reason why. A former Newton cadet and current East Los Angeles College student, Soberano said she "practically grew up" at Newton station. "Some of my best friends came from this program," she said. "I learned a lot from it, and I still want to be a part of it." That's why she was there on Saturday, to volunteer. </p>

<p>Soberano said there are plenty of kids in the area who could benefit from PAL. </p>

<p>"There are some kids who aren't necessarily in trouble, but all they do is stay home and play video games," she said. "They’re very anti-social and when they come here, they make a lot of new friends. Some have parents who work all day, some are just shy and don’t want to talk to people. A lot don’t know about the program unless someone they know tells them about it." </p>

<p>From there, it's a simple process -- call Newton station and fill out an application. Everyone gets in.</p>

<p>"Lots of kids just come to the station to hang out here," said Soberano. "It's like a second home."</p>
