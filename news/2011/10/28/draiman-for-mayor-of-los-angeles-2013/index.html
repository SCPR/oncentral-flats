        <p>Draiman for Mayor of Los Angeles 2013</p>

<p>Y.J. "Jay" Draiman. - Candidate for Mayor of Los Angeles</p>

<p>YJ Draiman who ran last year for councilmen at District 12 in Los Angeles,</p>

<p>Draiman has formally filed paper to run for Mayor of Los Angeles – March 5, 2013.</p>

<p>Y.J. "Jay" Draiman. - Candidate for Mayor of Los Angeles</p>

<p>Draiman is an Energy Efficiency Advocate and the lead elected official with the goal of Energy Conservation for the Northridge East Neighborhood Council - NENC, from Northridge, California. Draiman is also the liaison between the NENC and LADWP. Draiman is known for his advancement of implementing Energy efficiency, Renewable energy and Water conservation in the Los Angeles Area. Draiman is promoting the theme of Made in America, bringing back Los Angeles's industrial base, increase employment and reduce government with fiscal responsibility. Draiman ran for Los Angeles City Council in 2010. A recent ambitious goal by Draiman is to create in Los Angeles an innovative renewable energy zone approach which will create 200,000+ new jobs with billions in investments over the next 5-10 years.</p>

<p>Draiman is a former Real Estate developer with over 20 year’s experience. Draiman has extensive experience in the deregulation of Utilities and implementing energy and water conservation.</p>

<p>In January 1996 Draiman was asked to run for U.S. Senate, but He declined. </p>

<p>Draiman is currently working on his PHD in energy conservation.</p>

<p>                  Draiman for Mayor of Los Angeles 2013</p>

<p>I believe that if people know the rules and are sensitized by art, humor, and creativity, they are more likely to accept change.<br />The crucial point of a citizens' culture is learning to correct others without mistreating them or generating aggression. We need to create a society in which civility rules over cynicism and apathy.<br />http://www.draimanformayor.net</p>

<p>Draiman said... <br />Tough words -- responsibility, leadership and public trust. They are even tougher to put into practice and blend into your own character. But if we are successful in building our character into a reflection of what those words mean, the personal reward is worth far more than the effort required. Peace of mind, respect, admiration and the ability to withstand life's curve balls are a few of the benefits of being a person of character. I am still working on my character, and believe me, I still have a long way to go. I hope you also think it is a worthwhile, lifelong endeavor. </p>

        <p>His name is YJ Draiman, and he wants to be your next Mayor.  </p>

<p>   The son of European immigrants, YJ Draiman was born in 1949. He was reared in Brooklyn, New York. After graduating from High School, he studied Engineering in New York City. In 1971, he got married and went to work as a Mechanical Engineer in the printing industry.</p>

<p>    In 1975, YJ moved to Chicago where he initially worked as an Administrator in a Healthcare facility. But for most of his adult life, YJ has been a businessman. He rehabilitated apartment buildings, he owned a Real Estate Office, and Draiman partnered in a Natural Gas Exploration venture and operated a chain of electronic stores. In 1984, he started marketing Deregulated natural gas, natural gas futures hedging and Efficiency in Energy, Water, Telecom and Utility Services. He’s been active in this business ever since. He’s been recognized by the Illinois State Commerce Commission as a Utilities Expert.</p>

<p>   In 2005, YJ came to Los Angeles. He resides in Northridge and has lived there ever since.  As a resident of Northridge, he developed an interest in the Northridge East Neighborhood Council (NENC). In 2010 he was elected as a Member of the Council’s Board of Directors. Today, he’s the Secretary and he serves on both the Executive and Finance Committees. Moreover, YJ also represents the NENC on the Northridge Vision Organization. In 2010 YJ was a candidate for Councilman in the 12th District. YJ is currently working on his PHD in Energy conservation.</p>

<p>   YJ Draiman wants to be your Mayor! He feels his successful business experience has given him the skills, abilities and insights needed to balance the interests of the City’s very diverse communities. In the end, YJ believes all Angelinos (himself included) expect City government to be effective and efficient—to provide excellent services at an affordable price.</p>

<p>      YJ reminds Angelinos, “Don’t forget that our City normally gets more sunlight than any other city in America. That fact must be used to our advantage. We will determine if it’s feasible to call Los Angeles the Solar City.  We will explore the possibility of turning the whole City into “The World Capital of Renewable Energy”. That would attract billions of investment dollars to Los Angeles. It would facilitate the start-up of many small, energy-related businesses. It would create jobs and generate tax revenues.”</p>

<p>      YJ is a family man. He and his wife, Miriam, have two adult sons, David 39 a lead singer for Disturbed and Benjamin, 36 a psychologist. He’s at a point in his life where he feels he can give something back to the country that has treated his family so well. He’d welcome comments/question from those who read this column, and can be reached by phone at:     (818) 366-6999, or with an e-mail yjdraimanformayor@yjdraiman.org. r11</p>

        <p>His name is YJ Draiman, and he wants to be your next Mayor</p>

<p>He’s agreed to let me use his campaign material to introduce him to the readers of this column. He’s aware this is not an endorsement—that other candidates may ask for the same courtesy. He’s OK with that.</p>

<p>But Los Angeles has several problems that demand immediate attention. YJ agrees that the City’s civil service system does not appear to be well-managed. One thing is clear: The people of Los Angeles should not be expected to sit and watch while their leaders spend 60 percent of the City budget to support an under-utilized workforce. And asking budgetary departments to manage themselves—without effective accountability—doesn’t serve the public interest. </p>

<p>   Recently, questions have been raised about the City’s tax collection procedure. It’s speculated that the City regularly fails to collect all the taxes it’s owed. Cynics ask if there’s a connection between City Hall’s annual budget gap and the chronic failure to collect all the taxes owed. YJ doesn’t share that cynicism, but he does think an independent audit may be useful. </p>

<p>To achieve those goals, YJ is committed to an ambitious jobs program: he’ll bring back those businesses that were forced—by the City’s high tax rate—to leave Los Angeles. Moreover, he’ll actively support the creation of new businesses in renewable energy and energy conservation.<br /></p>

        <p>Are LA voters angry enough to change the current administration at Los Angeles City Hall???</p>

<p>LA voters in the March 2011 Elections voted for incumbents - People do not care, why???<br /> <br />Why do we think LA city election on March 5, 2013 will be any different???</p>

<p>I would think with the poor performance and dismal track record by the current administration, the voters would demand to change the current administration at LA City Hall.<br />4 of the current LA Mayoral candidates are mostly recycled LA City Council members who have proven themselves unworthy by their repeated failure to solve the City’s problems and Council staff members who have demonstrated their loyalty and obedience to their pockets, like well-trained dogs.</p>

<p>The performance of the current administrations borders on criminal neglect.<br />In order to move forward, we must educate the voters, let them know that the current administration goals are business as usual, there will be no significant changes and the city will be heading into bankruptcy.  The escalating costs of pensions and benefits will drain most of the city budget as we head into 2020. The increased taxes and fees on residents and businesses will push people and businesses to leave the city. This again will reduce revenues to the city.<br />The city must initiate an austerity program. Cut salaries and benefits across the board, increase efficiency and performance. The Police Department should utilize civil service employees for clerical work, not Police Officers. The city must tighten its belt and reduce taxes and fees, streamline bureaucracy. Promote the health of existing businesses and actively go after new businesses.  Any city employee who is not performing his job to standards should be put on suspension without pay or benefits and if such action has not improved the workers performance, the worker/employee should be terminated.  The city must utilize its most expensive resource, its employees more efficiently, promote a good work environment and reward exceptional performance.  People must realize that if they do not do their job, they will have no job and no means of support. The city must streamline management and reduce management costs. A high administrative cost is not prudent and not sustainable. LA’s employee costs are one of the highest in the country.  We need a change in attitude, and that starts at the top. As they say in good leadership, “follow me”.<br /> <br />The main question is, why LA voters don&#39;t care, why they are resigned to accept failure and diminishing LA city services.<br /> <br />Can we not find a leader who will motivate City Hall and initiate hard choices to bring the city to financial health?<br /> <br />City elections should be held on the first Tuesday of November with all the other elections to Federal, County &amp; State.<br />It will reduce costs and increase voter turnout.<br />The peoples brigade for honest government </p>

        <p>The Pension Crisis – YJ Draiman</p>

<p>Pension reform plan must be devised and put into affect as soon as possible. Every day we wait is an economic drain and an ultimate cause for the failure of government fiscal responsibility, it also increase the potential for bankruptcy. It is an economic suicide and a dereliction of duty for officials not to devise and implement a viable Pension reform, with a short term plan and a long term plan, allowing for modification when necessary.<br />We have to make an equitable Pension reform plan that all parties can live with. It is in the best interest of everyone, we all have to compromise.<br />A legal battle will only exasperate the financial situation and will have a disastrous affect on the financial sustainability of the government and the people.<br />Stop bickering among yourselves and jockeying for position; you are playing with people’s livelihood. Do the jobs you were elected to do or else resign.<br />Politicians all too often think about the next election. Statesmen think about the next generation. </p>

<p>YJ Draiman</p>

<p>http://www.yjdraiman.org</p>

<p>PS<br />I look forward to the day when only statesmen will run for office.</p>

<p>A statesman is a servant leader who is not concerned about his political future, but in what is best for the people. A statesman is open-minded, logical, intelligent and compassionate. A statesman reconciles conflict and looks into the future.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many elected officials are not statesmen or even leaders. They are in office to make themselves feel important, to gain power and sometimes to get money. This kind of elected official is caustic, negative and hateful who stirs up messes, acts self-righteous, gets personal and calls other people names, and is the first to claim he is not a &quot;politician&quot; and that he &quot;is working for the people.&quot; Some think success is getting their picture in the paper handing out a check. Some elected officials think their job is to be against the chief and other elected officials regardless of the issue.</p>

<p>Please think about the kind of people we need in public office to make good decisions for the present and the future. We don&#39;t need gainers; we don&#39;t need self-serving politicians. We need positive leaders and statesmen. Talk to those in office and those running against them. Look at their service history and decide for yourself if they are true statesmen. </p>

<p>This type of elected official is not a statesman. A statesman does not buy votes with &quot;quick fix&quot; hand-outs. A statesman makes the tough decisions. He considers all his constituents. He has a vision and a long-term plan.</p>

        <p>Los Angeles Economic Development – YJ Draiman</p>

<p>It is time to remake Los Angeles in the image of our boldest vision – a city of healthy communities with good schools and quality education, innovative companies in new and emerging sectors, quality open space, improved public transportation, a range of mobility and housing options; and above all, a prosperous and productive middle class equipped with the skills and education to create a better future. </p>

<p>It is time to get serious about designing a real economic development program linked to investments in healthy communities. I recently proposed to make Los Angeles the World Capital of Renewable Energy, Energy and Water Efficiency.  We have the climate, the manpower, the resources and technology.  We must promote energy and water efficiency in all sectors of LA’s economy.  This by itself can save the city billions and bring many jobs and economic growth into Los Angeles. We should promote real estate gentrification, affordable housing, urban infill building, economic development and clean tech sorted through the parts of redevelopment worth retaining and retooling combined with some newer elements of economic development necessary to realize this vision of healthy communities.  </p>

<p>In the past five years many businesses in LA have closed down or moved out.  There are many vacant properties (commercial and residential).  Many people have moved out of LA.  They can not afford the cost of living, the high taxation, the stifling bureaucracy and varied rules and regulations that choke business development.</p>

<p>We have a dysfunctional leadership in Los Angeles, an inefficient workforce, a demand for entitlement, and crippling budget deficits that are creating an environment of uncertainty for many companies who want to hire people, but are afraid to do so. Capital is stagnant and unattainable, frozen by an over swing of regulation and bureaucracy. We want to get Los Angeles working again, yet many of our wounds are self inflicted, as LA bureaucrats go to work every day piling more regulations and taxes onto the very businesses we ask to grow and create more jobs.  This situation must change, or we are doomed.</p>

<p>It is imperative that we reverse this trend.</p>

<p>A free America... means just this: individual freedom for all, rich or poor, or else this system of government we call democracy is only an expedient to enslave man to the machine and make him like it.</p>

        <p>Who is qualified to be the next mayor of Los Angeles 2013?</p>

<p>Any of the current elected officials at LA City Hall who are running, do not qualify to be the Mayor of LA. Their past poor performance and their contribution to the current state of affairs are reprehensible. They do not deserve to be elected again for any position in LA City Hall and especially to the position of Mayor of LA.</p>

<p>I hope and trust that the people of LA are not as gullible as the current elected officials presume.</p>

<p>It is time for the voters of LA to elect a person who cares about the people of this great city of Los Angeles, a city with a population of about 4 million people and 281 square miles. The current elected officials at city hall have abused their position; they have failed the people of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The current elected officials at LA city hall should get a verbal lynching for their performance. The City of Los Angeles is in its worst condition in this century. The cause of this despicable condition is the product of the current administration.</p>

<p>It is time to elect officials who truly care about the people and the city of LA. Officials who exercise their elected position for the good of the people of LA, not what is in it for them?</p>

<p>When we support current elected officials in their quest to become the Mayor of Los Angeles, we consent to their poor performance and induce them to continue to destroy our city.</p>

<p>We must change the status quo of business as usual; the current administration has abused its position and trust. Otherwise we as the people of LA will pay a heavy price for such negligence. </p>

<p>This is the message we should be sending to people who seek public office. A candidate must have honesty and integrity as a primary character trait and above all the public’s trust.</p>

<p>YJ Draiman</p>

<p>PS.</p>

<p>A question to the people of Los Angeles</p>

<p>Do you have confidence in your current elected officials in Los Angeles City Hall?<br />Are they doing a good job?</p>

<p>No, why?</p>

<p>Yes, why?</p>

<p>Who is qualified to be the mayor of Los Angeles 2013?<br />Where there is discord, the mayor will bring harmony. Where there is error, the mayor will bring truth. Where there is doubt, the mayor will bring faith. And where there is despair, the mayor will bring hope.  The mayor will unite the city and promote economic prosperity successfully. A person who can do these things is the one qualified to be the mayor of Los Angeles in 2013.</p>

        <p>The only way for the people of Los Angeles to take over their city is Elect YJ Draiman for Mayor<br />We should demonstrate in the streets, to wake up the masses, to expose the truth, to prove that the current administration has destroyed our city’s economic vitality.<br />Draiman is the only candidate at this time that could unite the city of Los Angeles, who could appeal to all the political parties, with a program that could look to the future and focus Los Angeles on its purposes. Draiman has the right chemistry to bridge the gap and unify our city for the common good.<br />We should give Draiman a chance – try it you will like it. The people of Los Angeles will be the better under the leadership of YJ Draiman.<br />A corruptive and corrosive power could exist and be nurtured by the peoples apathy. Therefore to change, the people must overcome the apathy and vote their conscience.<br />This is the only way a change for the better will occur in Los Angeles.<br />James D<br /></p>
