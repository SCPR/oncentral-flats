        <p><i>This is the first in a series of Q&As with members of the South L.A. community about the <a href="../../29/shattering-south-la-20-years-after-riots/index.html" target="_blank">riots of 1992</a>.</i></p>

<p>Captain Phillip Tingirides of the LAPD's Southeast Division was around for both of South Los Angeles' major riots: the ones in 1965 and the ones that happened 20 years ago in 1992.</p>

<p>A native Angeleno, Tingirides entered the LAPD in 1980 after a stint in the military. His first division was Southeast – at the time, a station that was only a couple years old. Over the next three-plus decades, he's worked in several divisions on a wide variety of assignments, including vice, gangs, community relations and administration. He's done a lot of patrol time and was deeply involved in the Rampart Scandal investigation in the late '90s, which some say is the point that marks beginning of the LAPD's attempt to begin a transformation of its organization. </p>

<p>He remembers the Watts Riots of '65 like it was yesterday. "I can very vividly remember looking east down Century Boulevard and seeing the smoke, seeing the fires," he said. After those riots, Tingirides, seven at the time, remembers watching a police car with two cops pull someone over. When he asked his grandmother why there were two, she said, "Well, since the riots, things have really gotten bad around here."</p>

<p>She couldn't have been more right. That bout of unrest was the beginning of a slow devastation of an area that was once a cultural, thriving hub. Tingirides said his area, before and during the riots, was "still very prominently white," while the far east side was primarily black, with some Latino presence. Westward from Avalon Boulevard was mostly white and black. Main Street to the beach was "very white."</p>

<p>Then the "white flight" began, said Tingirides. "What that ended up causing was a lot of people who had jobs, who had money, who bought their homes, to leave," he said. "There was a lot of employment down here, a lot of functioning stores down here, and the riots wiped out a lot of those stores, and caused people who were going to those stores to up and leave. It killed business here. It just made the property values plummet." Tingirides' grandparents, who'd been in the area for ages, were some of the ones who left – they went to Long Beach.</p>

<p>That flight was indicative of where South L.A. was after 1965. "This place was falling apart," said the captain, because people were afraid. "What ended up being left was a very dysfunctional community, especially in Southeast." The crime was enough to keep legitimate businesses away, leaving start-ups that had little to lose. "The last thing you want is to have some video on the news or TV that people are coming in, committing crimes in your restaurant," Tingirides said. "That's a true fear down here."</p>

<p>Then, a little more than two decades later, April 29, 1992 happened.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>April 29, 1992: Where were you?</b><br />I was assigned to Hollywood Division and I was on my day off in Long Beach. I saw the verdict and watched the Florence and Normandie incident on TV and jumped in the car and went in to work at Hollywood. Got into work about 7:30 p.m. that night and was down in South L.A. within an hour or two of getting to work.</p>

<p><b>What were you thinking on the drive up?</b><br />I could tell by that time it was going to turn into something big because as I was going north on the Long Beach freeway, I could see smoke everywhere.</p>

<p><b>You were in Hollywood, but were being sent to South L.A.. Was it an all-hands-on-deck kind of thing?</b><br />Right. It was all forces go down there, and they had a command post near 54th and Arlington. And I got there and it was a cluster. There was no leadership or organization there. And quite literally when I got there, the guy who had been the watch commander at 77th St. Division in the area where the incendiary incident had occurred was there – and he was just walking around in a daze.</p>

<p><b>Were there a lot of people wandering around in a daze?</b><br />There was a lot of cops that were there that were waiting to be given assignments, and I'm not very good at sitting around, waiting. So I started organizing a squad of seven officers and asked for a mission. I wanted to get out of there as quickly as I could because I knew it was very dysfunctional and there was a lot of things going on and no police out there. I could not from a moral standpoint be a part of that.</p>

<p><b>Had you been told to hold back?</b><br />No. I knew people who were working in the area at the time who told me later that they were on the way there, and that they were told directly by that watch commander to pull back and not go there. I didn't know that at the time, and nobody ever told me not to go there.</p>

<p>As soon as we got out, we saw some people looting a store, and we started arresting people. And as we did and I got on the radio to start asking people to come and help transport, but I couldn't get ahold of anybody. </p>

<p><b>Why not?</b><br />They weren't answering their radio! There was nobody on the frequency they gave us. So ultimately afterwards – I had a fit. I told the officers just un-handcuff those guys and get them out of here and I went back to the command post and found the watch commander and went off on him. What the hell are you guys doing, you know? You send us out there, we're out there, nobody's listening on the radio. If something bad were to happen, we're screwed.</p>

<p>So eventually we got back out, and I was very clear that LAPD was not prepared to accept any arrests. So from that point on until around midnight, we just went and were getting people out of locations, stopping people from going and breaking anything that we could. I'm not sure how much we stopped, other than the fact that we were out there and a presence. </p>

<p>A little before midnight we were here in Southeast Division around Broadway and Manchester and a help call came out somewhere up by 77th St. Station. So we were two cars with eight officers total, and as we passed the apartment building at 8217 Broadway, there was a guy on the balcony and he unloaded on us with a handgun. He hit  our car and the car behind us. We end up coming back around and he was gone.</p>

<p>After we got shot, we went to refuel and we got a new mission: to provide security for a fire department task force. So we spent the rest of the night until about noon the next day following fire from one place to another. And that was a hilarious trip.</p>

<p><b>Hilarious?</b><br />The fire department is very much in tune with procedure, and their procedure was to handle calls in the order they were received. So we were following the fire, and they would get dispatched on a call, and they would drive 98 miles an hour from wherever they were to that next fire call. We would be passing places that were ablaze to get to a location where the fire had already burned out because the call had been an hour-and-a-half old. And so they got there and they would move the ashes around and put it out and go to the next call – where we'd pass 40 more fires to get to a fire that's out.</p>

<p>Finally I asked the battalion chief – "What are you doing? I don't get it." And he said, "We have to go where we're dispatched." It was the most ridiculous thing in the world.</p>

<p><b>Did you think it was time to start breaking the rules and start putting out fires?</b><br />Hell yes! It's the right thing to do. And it cracked me up because to me, it was the ultimate, "I only do what I'm told, not what's right." I follow the rules instead of doing what works. And not that I believe in being a rule-breaker, but there's a difference between breaking a rule that's the law and breaking a rule that for this circumstance makes no sense.</p>

<p><b>Then what'd you do?</b><br />That next night, I was in Hollywood, and they had asked for more resources down to South L.A.. By this time, the looting and rioting had spread throughout the area, and it was happening in Hollywood, so the watch commander in Hollywood said you ain't going nowhere. So I got another seven folks and we went out and started doing suppression and made a very significant number of arrests. I was very outspoken that just to drive around and push people out of buildings was useless – we needed to take a stand and start arresting people.</p>

<p><b>As a white police officer, did you encounter a lot of racial tension, or even vitriol?</b><br />Well, in Hollywood it was not the same. In Hollywood the riots of South L.A. became a mob mentality and excuse to steal stuff. It was not a racial riot in Hollywood. Did we get the people that started yelling about Rodney King––</p>

<p><b>What would they yell?</b><br />You would get a lot of people yelling, "This is what you guys get," or "You guys were out beating people," or "F*** you" – that kind of stuff. Nothing direct, because most of them didn't even know that much about Rodney King. It was just an excuse to riot.</p>

<p><b>What did it look like in South L.A. during the days following the Florence and Normandie incident?</b><br />The night that I was doing the fire task force and into the next day, the street was cluttered with newspaper racks, bus benches, trash cans. That first night, we saw a car driving around Florence and Crenshaw and it was two white girls who were coming from the Laker game at the Forum, and they got lost. And they were driving in and throughout and everything was on fire and they were in tears. They were lost, they were scared to death, they lived in Orange County, so we stopped them just to see what they were doing, and when we found out what was going on, we escorted them to the freeway.</p>

<p>Buildings on both sides of the street were on fire. Places were gutted everywhere. That night, it was complete and utter chaos.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>What were you feeling at that time? Were you scared?</b><br />I wasn't scared – I was frustrated. I was frustrated that there was so much going on and it was a feeling of helplessness.</p>

<p><b>Did you feel like LAPD's infrastructure had failed that night?</b><br />Yeah, I was very ashamed. Because I was watching when Reginald Denny got pulled out of the truck at Florence and Normandie and thought, "Where are we? Why aren't we there?" I watched that on TV and I was dumbfounded that you've got news helicopters over this and there's not a cop around. I've worked the area and I know how quickly we can get to things. I was dumbfounded. I was embarrassed.</p>

<p>But I have to say the command structure at that time was very, very different than it is now.</p>

<p><b>Is it different because of what happened during the riots?</b><br />No, I think it's largely in part because of [former Chief of Police] Bill Bratton. Bratton promoted people who could think on their own, had job experience, were people with some courage and weren't afraid to get their hands dirty and do the job. He promoted people who did the job correctly. Back then, the people that were promoted were promoted because they had a friend, because they went to the same church.</p>

<p><b>It wasn't always the best man or woman for the job.</b><br />It was terrible! It was a bunch of people that were inexperienced in law enforcement – and not all of them – but I can think of a number of people who were in command back then because of who they knew or the inside jobs they worked, and not because of their job experience, intestinal fortitude, courage or moral structure.</p>

<p><b>Do you think that had a lot to do with the way the riots played out in the very early stages at Florence and Normandie? Would something have been different if the current leadership structure had been in place then?</b><br />Absolutely. Absolutely. It would have been different because there would have been a stand taken. I don't know if that would have stopped the riot altogether – ultimately there was a riot because of the relationship between the police department and the community. So it may not have happened that day, but it would have happened. But I still believe we had a moral obligation to go in there and stop that man from being beaten. And if the riots still happen, they still happen. I think as a result of the riots, it caused us to do a better job of looking at ourselves. We had changes throughout the department.</p>

<p>We've made tremendous progress and completely turned around the relationship between the community and the police department. And if we were in a position where we had a community that was so angry to the point where they wanted to riot again, I would do everything in my power to try and convince people that there has to be another way to fix the problem. And if you have a community that's that close to rioting, there's a problem that needs to be fixed. And it's probably not their problem.</p>

<p><b>What was that problem in '92? Rodney King was the catalyst, but what was the real problem?</b><br />Well, the African-American community felt very strongly that the police disrespected them, did nothing but put their young in jail, shoot their young, armed or unarmed – all the while treating them very badly. And whether that was true or not, that was the perception. </p>

<p><b>But Rodney King took 56 baton blows and six kicks – after getting tazed.</b><br />Well if you watch the video, the incident took place over a minute, but they were doing what they were trained to do, and that is to go in, to strike, and then give verbalization to try and gain compliance. And if you watch, that's what you see. And I wasn't there, but that's how I understand it, that's what's on the video and that's the unfortunate part of it – they didn't give us a tool to deal with this new drug, PCP, which had been pretty prevalent for about 10 years. [Tingirides said King was on PCP when he was pulled over by the officers.] But in those 10 years they had taken away the one effective tool we had – the chokehold –  and they gave us a taser. And it didn't work. But the baton's all they had left.</p>

<p>And that's the downside to it all. And I think that the result of that was a lot of cops going, "Whoa! But for the grace of God, that could me. That's what they tell us to do, that's what they teach us to do, and now these guys are going to jail?" And as a result of that, you saw police work go [down], and guys just literally stopped doing a lot of work. And over the next few years, that's when crime was just in an unbelievable state in this city.</p>

<p><b>Especially in South L.A.</b><br />Especially in South L.A. because you mix that with the influx of rock cocaine, and the gang battles that were going on over the rock cocaine. In 1992, the Bloods and the Crips signed a peace treaty down in South L.A. and you started to see gang violence drop. But it didn't last that long because they started getting together and drinking and partying, and as soon as the alcohol hit, they went back to their old ways. All of a sudden we're right back where we were.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<p><b>So if the '65 riots devastated South L.A., what did the '92 riots do?</b><br />I think it just put it farther behind.</p>

<p><b>Was it in recovery?</b><br />Probably a very, very, very slow recovery. And anybody that might have been thinking about coming down here and bringing business down here went away. Because how long until the next one?</p>

<p><b>Do you think LAPD learned a lesson from '92?</b><br />I would say yes, absolutely, but not until 10 years later.</p>

<p><b>What happened 10 years later?</b><br />I think the City Council and the community wanted Daryl Gates [who had been chief of police during the riots] out, and they got that [in 1992]. Later that year we got a new chief. And from my perspective, with the selection process, I saw that there were two requirements for that chief: that was he black, and that he was not from within the LAPD. So they picked Willie Williams, former police chief of Philadelphia. And Willie came, and he was the start of a complete reduction of productivity and focus on crime and the mission. </p>

<p>[After him, current City Councilman] Bernard Parks came in [as police chief] with a real agenda for the department. He had a very strong and firm belief that the LAPD was a very racist and very aggressive police department against minority communities, and that we were – I don't want to use the word corrupt, because since I've been here we've never been corrupt – but disrespectful.</p>

<p><b>Was he right?</b><br />To an extent, he was. I would say that he absolutely was. How he handled it, he came in with an iron fist. He came in with such strong disciplinary policies that he completely and totally shut down work in the department. And I'm still not sure I believe he did the right thing or not. It may have been the right thing at the time. It may have been whether he intended it to be or not, part of a process that ultimately worked, but he dragged the department down so badly, that by the time he left, this department was looking for a leader that was supportive of officers and what they were supposed to be doing, that even a guy like Bratton looked good.</p>

<p>And I have the deepest respect for Bill Bratton. I think he was a phenomenal chief; I think he was the perfect person at the perfect time to come in. That was in 2002. I think he was the perfect guy for the time. And he turned this department around completely and he set it on the right course. I'm not sure he could have done it as easily or as quickly, if he wasn't preceded by Parks, who was so despised by the officers in the department, who felt that they were being treated unfairly, and felt that that everything they did was scrutinized, that if somebody came up and arbitrarily accused me of something, I'd be pulled out of the field and put on a desk. And it was from one extreme to the next extreme, and then Bill Bratton brought some sense to it.</p>
