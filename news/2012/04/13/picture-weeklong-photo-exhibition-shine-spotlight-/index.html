        <p>Central Avenue, one of the southside's main thoroughfares (and the namesake for this blog), is about to quite literally be in focus.</p>

<p>That's because the Central Avenue community album photo exhibition begins Saturday night, and will be open daily starting Monday through next Saturday, the 21st. It'll take place, appropriately, on the intersection of its namesake street and Adams Boulevard.</p>

<p>"Really it was an idea that was birthed out of several people, and it kind of gelled," said Vivian Bowers, one of the event's co-organizers. Bowers is the owner of Bowers & Sons Cleaners on Central, nearby where the exhibition will be held.</p>

<p>"We were at a [Central Avenue Business Association] meeting and were talking about things that could generate interest along Central Avenue," she continued. "Two of our members began to talk about art, and how art is just missing from the avenue." Sam Comen, another event co-organizer and the exhibition's photographer, just happened to be at that meeting with a friend, and he mentioned doing a photo exhibition.</p>

<p>"And we all just began to talk about the possibilities," said Bowers.</p>

<p>The exhibit will feature both photos submitted by community members and ones taken by Comen, who said taking and compiling photos for the project has been "illuminating."</p>

<p>"In addition to walking the streets and canvassing and taking photos, I've been invited into people's homes and I've really gotten to see many first-person perspectives of life here through all of Central Avenue's changes," he said. "From the apex of its culture to the darkest days of poverty."</p>

<p>Comen, a photographer and photojournalist who's also done work for Newsweek, Rolling Stone and MTV, called working on the project a "privilege" and said there were a few surprises. In one photo, he said, there's a young girl coming home from her First Holy Community "in a beautiful white dress."</p>

<p>"And it's the perfect slice of life," laughed Comen, "and she looks like a perfect little angel, and I look at the picture, and in her hands, she's holding a bagel. So it was just unexpected."</p>

<p>The project, which he called "a community revival," put a lot of evocative photos in front of Comen.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of one photo in particular," he said. "It's like an updated version of American Gothic, photographed in the late 30s, early 40s. It's a very stern couple – a man and woman and their young nieces and nephews. And it struck me that their emotion is quintessentially American and perfectly timeless, and it just happens to be in the setting of South L.A. at the beginning of L.A.'s rise to prominence.</p>

<p>"That really wrung out for me," he added. "That was one that struck me."</p>

<p>Bowers says it's important that people are struck the way Comen was.</p>

<p>"It's important because so many people do not know that this area is steeped in a rich history," she said. "Many of the young people that are here now and/or the people who have migrated here have no idea what it once was – to me, that means they cannot have a vision of where we can go."</p>

<p>In other words, moving forward requires a look back, said Bowers.</p>

<p>"If you think this is all that has ever been here, you can envision the commerce that once was, the people that once were, the beauty and elegance that once was," she said.</p>

<p>Comen looked at it in light of the upcoming 20th anniversary of the South Central riots of 1992.</p>

<p>"I think it's important to bring to light the everyday texture of daily life, and really to not just focus on the tragedy of '92 and point it back toward Central Avenue's major cultural contributions," he said. "It's important to point to the normal, all-American day-to-day life of celebrations and families and those kinds of things that are really important – to realize that those are going on during all points of Central Avenue's past."</p>

<p>The opening reception for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/263975363690596/" target="_blank">"Central Avenue: A Community Album"</a> will take place Saturday, April 14 from 7 p.m. - 10 p.m. at 2515 South Central Avenue (at Adams Boulevard).</p>

<p>The gallery will be remain open from April 16 through April 21, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
