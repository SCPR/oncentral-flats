        <p>The lack of stadium lights at Jefferson High School meant football night games were unheard of. </p>

<p>But today, a year after students and the LAPD's Newton Division raised funds for portable stadium lights, the atmosphere on campus has changed dramatically, school officials said.</p>

<p>Students are eager and excited about attending football games, along with friends, family — and perhaps most significantly, all under the early autumn night sky.</p>

<p>Jefferson's first night game couldn't have been scripted better. A sold out game, with the stands holding about 5,000 fans was the perfect backdrop for the historic home game under the big bright lights. The Jefferson Democrats, or Demos, defeated their long-time rival, Freemont High. </p>

<p>From the time Jefferson High School first opened its doors in 1916 till 2010, it had been limited to football day-games, drawing a small crowd, said Principal Michael Taft. It had never experienced the Friday night light games that, with the introduction of TV shows such as “Friday Night Lights” made it apparent that football night games were a staple of the American high school experience.</p>

<p>It was with the help of HEART and local community donations, particularly the Newton division of LAPD, that portable light systems were first brought in to the campus.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a permanent solution, but for a school that had never had an evening game since it first opened, it was legendary.</p>

<p>The introduction of evening games had an immediate effect on the campus, and things haven’t been quite the same since. Alumni from the school’s Golden Years in athletics during the 1950s began attending games, and crime went down, said Jason Anderson, the school's Athletic Director.</p>

<p>Taft added the successful implementation of the evening games inevitably drew up revenue at the student store and concessions stands, opening the doors to the addition of more extracurricular activities and sports such as tennis and track and field.</p>

<p>The stands currently hold close to 5,000 and about 2,500 people now fill up the stands regularly at home games, something completely unheard of before. </p>

<p>Laura Gomez, a senior at Jefferson and president of HEART, remembers how after speaking with the alumni present at the games, she found that the same issues and concerns they had experienced — safety, trust in the school — are the same issues current students at Jefferson have.</p>

<p>Most importantly, she said, was the desire to be "a normal high school."</p>

<p>After the riots on school grounds in 2005, administrators and residents in South L.A. were hesitant and skeptical about the prospect of hosting evening games. When the campus was renovated, the football field was again left without stadium lights, she said.</p>

<p>The penetrating fear at the time in the neighborhood was that Jefferson High was in a gang-infested neighborhood, and hosting football night games was a safety issue, said Alonzo Marshall, a staff advisor for HEART.</p>

<p>But the students thought differently, he said, and they were determined to show that the school and neighborhood was ready to host its first football night game. </p>

<p>And they did. All sorts of residents from the neighborhood have shown up to games, from students to local gang members to alumni, all looking to root for their alma mater, Gomez said.</p>

<p>The switch from day-games to evening slots also meant that the players' families could attend. That support was noticeable the very first game, Laura Gomez said.</p>

<p>“You just see the football players looking up in the stands for their parents whereas before they didn’t have any support from their friends, or their family members,” she said.</p>

<p>Prior to the addition of the portable stadium lights, the school was, understandably, less interested in football.</p>

<p>Marcus Stamps, a runningback-linebacker on the team, recalled the lackluster attendance at the day games from his first year. But now, he said, with the opportunity to do so something on a Friday evening, questions inevitably come up, with friends and classmates asking if there are upcoming home games.</p>

<p>"Because it’s night, it gives them that extra push,” Stamps said. </p>

<p>Having been a part of the first football team to play at under the early autumn sky is something Stamps is grateful for.</p>

<p><div class="story-addition"><div class="submitter">Addition by <a href="index.html#">Juan Mc</a>:</div><p>The pics are from our first night game this year.  Heart presented to Newton Station our desire to have lights, Newton found an organization to donate a portion of the funds and Officer Mark Morimoto of LAUSD Police worked with Newton they secured the rest of what was needed.  The idea came from when Council man Tom La Bonge paid for Hollywood High School to have their first night game when I was coaching there in 2006.  When I arrived and here in 2008 and Coach Wiltz took over, it was our mission to bring a night game to Jefferson. It took two years and the efforts of Allen Tuazon, School Social Worker, Jeremy Mc David, Assistant Principal, as well Heart for that to come to fruition.  Since then we&#39;ve had 8 home night games, including one playoff game, and we have not had one negative incident. </p><div class="submission-date">Added 10/27/11, 1:03 p.m.</div></div> </p>

<p>Thinking of the alumni who continue to attend games at their alma mater, Stamps said he, too, now has something he can claim as part of his legacy at Jefferson High.</p>

<p>Twenty years from now, he will be able to say, ‘I played at Jefferson when the lights were first brought in.'</p>

<p>Or, even better, he added, “ I’ll just come down here.”</p>

<p>Jefferson's homecoming game is scheduled for November 4, 2011.</p>
