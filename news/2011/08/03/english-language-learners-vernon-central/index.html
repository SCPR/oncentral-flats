        <p>As of 2010, L.A. Unified reported having 209,493 English language learners. The majority are placed in English-immersion programs, an approach mandated by Proposition 227 in 1998. </p>

<p>The latest data, from the class of 2008, showed that only 41.5 percent of students considered English language learners graduated from high school. Programs to teach English as flailing at Los Angeles Unified School District.</p>

<p>“That's a huge problem in LA Unified, and the reason for that is because they don't have good programs for ELLs,” said Concepcion Valadez, division head of Urban Schooling at UCLA. “If you don't have a good program then the children are not going to be learning English as they should — the kind of English that they need, and that's a perpetual problem.”</p>

<p>In addition to inadequate services, part of the issue is that English learners are not being identified and so are not getting the proper services they need.  </p>

<p>“I think that where most people get confused is that if they're in school, and they're speaking English then they should be able to achieve just like a native English speaker, but there's a language development issue as well as an academic development issue,” said Karen Cadiero-Kaplan, president of Californians Together, an advocacy organization concerned with the educational conditions of English-language learners.</p>

<p>In other words, children can learn to communicate in English fairly quickly — at that age, they're brains are primed to learn languages. However, these children may be missing out on services they may need in order to fully develop a working understanding of English, the kind of English that is being spoken in the classroom and being read in the textbooks.</p>

<p>“Each area of academics, whether it's social studies or math, has a very specific kind of language that goes with it,” said Laurie Olsen, author of study published by Californians Together that examines the issues of the long-term English learners. “That's not the way you would talk on the street.”</p>

<p>Children who are struggling with the language are not even being identified and become long-term English learners, Olsen said. Students who, according to a Californians Together study, despite being graduation age, are still not English proficient and fallen behind more and more each year. </p>

<p>According to the Californians Together study, several factors seem to contribute to becoming a long-term English learner: receiving no language development program at all; being given elementary school curricula and materials that weren’t designed to meet English learner needs; enrollment in weak language development program models and poorly implemented English learner programs.</p>

<p>The lack of services leads to retention, high drop-out rates and, if they do manage to get to college, students who still have to take classes to learn basic skills.  </p>

<p>In Vernon Central, most of these English learners speak Spanish and most are not immigrants, but the children of immigrants, born in the United States. Although born here, they speak Spanish pretty much everywhere except the classroom.  </p>

<p>“It's everywhere, and that's a great thing, but there's a problem with that as well,” said Elizabeth Gidon, bridge coordinator at Jefferson High School. “The kids have to learn English if they're going to succeed in college.” </p>

<p>Monica Sahagun, educational services manager at A Place Called Home, agrees.</p>

<p>“It's true, they need to learn English,” Sahagun said. “But that doesn't mean you need to negate that first language.”</p>

<p>The first language is the base from which to build upon. Research shows the best path to learning a new language is simultaneous development of the home language —Spanish — and the target language — English — at the same time. Bilingual and dual language programs can do that, Sahagun said.</p>

<p>“If taught in home language, they get the content and don't get behind,” Sahagun said.</p>

<p>Instead of abandoning the home language and starting all over, bilingual and dual-language programs develop the Spanish further, allow students to understand the material and keep up, and be taught English at the same time.</p>

<p>Last month, The L.A. Unified school board approved a resolution to protect about 200 dual-language teachers from layoffs in the coming year. But in Vernon Central, there are no dual-language programs available. </p>

<p>For Olsen, despite the lack of resources, it is an imperative that these students get the services they need. </p>

<p>“These are our kids,” she said. “It's a quarter of the kids in the state of California. in L.A. Unified I think it's almost, somewhere around half. It's who shows up at our schools' doors, and we're a public education system, committed to educating our public so how can we say we're not going to teach them what they need to know?” </p>
