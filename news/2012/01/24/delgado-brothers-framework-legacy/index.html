        <p>Between Avalon and Central runs a street with a particularly industrial feel: 59th Street, where bland warehouses often in need of repair loom on either side of the road and driving is hard on a car's shocks. There is one building, however, whose unassuming look betrays a rich history: Delgado Brothers Picture Frames.</p>

<p>Delgado Brothers was founded in 1967 by four of its namesakes: Antonio, Rafael, Epigmenio and Isauro. In those early days, only two of the employees at Delgado Brothers weren't, in fact, Delgado brothers, and all of them had to work 12-hour days six or seven days a week. At its peak, the frame manufacturer had a staff of about 140. </p>

<p>That's since dwindled down to 40 employees. The company's also seen a change in leadership -- Isauro retired to Mexico in 1972 and Epigmenio died in 1979; brothers Ramiro and Felipe took their spots -- as well as tougher economic times. But according to Ramiro, <a href="../../20/four-people-four-stories-history-through-eye/index.html" target="_blank">Delgado Brothers changed the way picture frames were made in the U.S</a>. In the midst of his 45th year as co-owner, Antonio Delgado sat down with OnCentral to talk about Delgado Brothers' impact on the frame industry, some of his more famous clients and how they have managed to stay afloat all these years.</p>

<p><b>OnCentral: So of all things, why picture frames?</b><br />Delgado: When I came to the United States, I started out working at L.A. Frame Company. Then they fired me. I didn’t know how to do anything else. So what am I going to do? I’m going to make picture frames. I love making picture frames. I used to be a teacher in Mexico, and when I went to L.A. Frame Company and worked there, I realized that was my cup of tea.</p>

<p><b>OnCentral: How's business?</b><br />Delgado: This week we’re good. When the economy is good, art is good; when the economy is bad, selling art and frames is extremely bad. We go week-by-week. The '90s were when everyone was busy in the industry … it started going downhill just before 9/11. Then after 9/11, from 2002-2006, it really went downhill. It got even worst from 2007-2010. People don't have money to buy right now. We're selling to the same people we always have, but they're buying less and less. We used to have multiple trucks loading and leaving all day long. Not anymore.</p>

<p><b>OnCentral: What happened? Why did the business go downhill?</b><br />Delgado: Well, when we started producing a long time ago, for this type of frame, we were the biggest manufacturers. Our main thing is frames for people who can afford to buy a decently-priced work of art and need a decently-priced frame to go with it. Then in the 1990s, there was a big art boom in the U.S., so Mexico started making frames -- they had a huge growth in frame manufacturing. But they were making them cheaper, with not as good quality. They were copying us. In the 1990s we had a lot of people who copied us. At the time, everyone was able to open a factory and copy our frames, and not only here but in Taiwan, Mexico -– all over. Production exploded, and there was a market for everyone. But now those manufacturers are out of Mexico. Here in L.A. there were three big factories copying us, and they’re history. We’ve always managed to be in the frontrunners in the industry in the L.A. area. We are bigger than everybody around here in the area, in L.A. County. And California, probably. But only for these types of frames.</p>

<p><b>OnCentral: How have you managed to stay in business?</b><br />Delgado: We were lucky. No other reason. We bought the building at a good time. Right now I cannot afford to charge rent to Delgado Brothers – the reason we’re surviving is because [my brothers and I] all absorb our own expenses.</p>

<p><b>OnCentral: So what does it mean that the Delgado Brothers changed the way picture frames were made in the U.S.?</b><br />Delgado: We designed something different that wasn’t there before. In those days you had to import everything from Europe; Europe was the number-one place where you got frame [molding] and it was [very] expensive. We didn’t copy Europe; we did something different. We used the big, wide linen liners [the material that outlines the work of art within the frame] that nobody was using. Because of that, the whole market started changing because others started copying what we were doing, using the liners we did. We were the first to use the big liners. And also different tones; we were the ones who started using the wood tones for the color of the frames; before they were gold or silver. We started putting wood tone in the frames; we started that finish, the walnut one, in particular. Then everybody started doing that.</p>

<p><b>OnCentral: How do you know you were the first to do that?</b><br />Delgado: You started seeing other framers in the U.S. do this after we started.</p>

<p><b>OnCentral: Who are your clients?</b><br />Delgado: The picture frame industry is very small. If you see what they are using at Wal-Mart or J.C. Penny, that’s a big industry, those frames you see in the big department stories. The frames that we make, for mid-level, pricier art, are not a big industry…it’s very small. In that industry, we had a big presence in the L.A. area. Then, of course, the people who bought from us here would send those frames all over the place. We had a particularly big impact on all the galleries around here. We sent a couple frames to Vietnam for General [William] Westmoreland [who commanded American troops at the peak of the Vietnam War]. The White House -– we’ve sent some frames there. I don’t recall who the president was at the time. We've made frames for the Hilton Hotels, the University of South California. We sent frames to Kodak's buildings in Japan. We’ve sent frames to Germany, Canada, Australia. We used to make frames for big banks presidents. We’ve sent two or three frames to the White House, and one frame to Pope Benedict XVI, a picture of the Queen of Angels. We sent it to the Vatican. </p>

<p><b>OnCentral: Was there ever a moment when you felt like the business wasn’t going to make it?</b><br />Delgado: Well, if I felt that way, I would close the doors and walk away. I always think that business is going to be good, someday or somehow. I’m very optimistic. And if it happens, it happens, I don’t have that thing in my mind.</p>

<p><b>OnCentral: How do you and your brothers get along?</b><br />Delgado: We all get along there very well. There are a lot of differences between us – I’m almost 20 years older than the youngest one. There’s a difference of ideas and that’s it. For me, it’s fun running a business with them.</p>

<p><b>OnCentral: If you hadn’t become a manufacturer of picture frames, what would you have done?</b><br />Delgado: This is the only trade that I know. I used to be a teacher, and I think I was a good teacher, but I didn’t like it. When I touch a piece of wood, that’s when I’m happy. Everybody I know is related to this business. A lot of friends, a lot of members of the family. My whole life is related to this thing. I’m very, very happy with picture frames.</p>
