        <p><i>In OnCentral's "South L.A. Snapshot" series, we provide you with a glimpse into the lives of everyday women and men in South Los Angeles. This time, we talked to <b>Demontae Thompson, 19</b>, who studies at California State University, Northridge and was the first graduate of the Digital Scholars program at the School of Black Leadership in the Digital Age. Through the program he was able to publish an autobiography, "Raised From Scratch," that describes his life as an emancipated foster child, along with his twin brother. </p>

<p>This question and answer session captured just a glimpse of what Thompson said loves to do, "motivate."</i></p>

<p><b>Tell me about CSUN.</b><br />It wasn't my first choice. Both my brother and I didn't get accepted and I felt kind of bad. But EOP [the Equal Opportunities Program] helped us both get in, with reasonable means. I started at CSUN and was just feeling kind of like, this place is great. I started embracing the squirrels [laughs], the nature. 'I thought, wow, this place is more enlightening than I ever thought. It was a different environment and I feel like I can really be myself here.</p>

<p><b>What's it like having a twin brother?</b><br />Growing up it was always like, "Oh, you're the bad twin, you're the good twin," you know, so they split us apart a little bit. And that could have probably led us to hating one another.. But we actually used each other – there are some things that he's good at, and some things I'm good at and we used it to our advantage. He's more of a money-making guy. Me, I'm more of the creating, writing idealist.  We have a brother/best friend/looking-at-yourself-in-the-mirror type of love. </p>

<p><b>Why did you chose to write an autobiography?</b> <br />What actually let me to write my inspirational autobiography was that I felt like some people can benefit from my story. From hearing my story, many foster youth or many minorities – who are really the majorities – can benefit from hearing about someone who has come from no parents or drug-abusing parents and who's come from those neglectful abandonment situations.That's something that I felt passionate about and I thought everyone should know about that. What also motivated me was I felt like was going through an identity crisis. I have a brother, I have a twin, but I also don't know who I am, in the sense of why am I here on this earth.</p>

<p><b>What is different about your story from other youth in South L.A.?</b><br />Generally many African-American young men are stereotyped to be aggressive or [have] "black angry man syndrome" or not to show any emotion, but I feel that's only the tip of the iceberg of our stories. But deep down inside, there are a lot of feelings that men are hiding. I really wanted everyone to know that yeah, men need love as well. Many things happened in my community – gang violence, drugs. Drugs were accessible to me. I could've done drugs, gotten into gangs red or blue, could have gotten shot.</p>

<p><b>What's in your book, "Raised From Scratch"?</b><br />In the first half, it goes over what has turned me into healthy man, not only body-wise but spiritually and wit-wise. You know, my uncle, he's 88 now, and he's been an inspirational piece of my life. My story is titled "Raised From Scratch" and in essence I wasn't literally raised from scratched – I was raised by everyone who was in my community. Everyone who supported me from the beginning and the others who offered me drugs. It travels through being an independent young man and my struggles with forgiving my mom and my dad for abusing drugs and for being absent in my life. How do I speak to them and understand the situation, and why they had to do what they did.</p>

<p><b>How does the stigma of South L.A. affect residents?</b><br />It probably makes individuals think they know the characters of African-American young men. I feel like there are a lot of us who are underrepresented and I need to be the example, be the inspiration to those who feel the same way that I do but that don't have the voice or artillery to speak. </p>

<p><b>You say you want to be an example – what kind of example do you want to be?</b><br />I want to be a versatile example. Not only an African-American young man that's in college – because not many of us are in college – but also a business man and an entrepreneur, not in the sense of making my own money but making my own inspiration. I think a lot of people need to know that they hold their futures in their own hands as well. I want to be a versatile inspiration, not only for foster youth, African-American young men, not only for people who don't know English as well as others, but also for those who feel they don't' belong in their surroundings. </p>
