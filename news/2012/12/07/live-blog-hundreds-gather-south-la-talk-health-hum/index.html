        <p><b>4:25 p.m.</b> – The third annual South Los Angeles Health & Human Rights Conference has ended, culminating in a mass signing and endorsement of the <a href="http://www.southlahealthandhumanrights.org/declaration.html" target="_blank">South Los Angeles Health & Human Rights Declaration</a> by attendees. </p>

<p>Until next year.</p>

<p><center>––</center></p>

<p><b>4:18 p.m.</b> – The city's four major mayoral candidates took center stage for the conference's final panel, which was moderated by the head of the Community Clinic Association of L.A. County, Louise McCarthy.</p>

<p>After introductions by all four mayoral candidates, they first tackled parks – green spaces where people could be physically active.</p>

<p>Candidate Eric Garcetti, who currently represents the 13th District in the L.A. City Council, said he wants to make sure "we have a park within walking distance of every Angeleno," noting that he tripled the number of parks in his district over the course of about a decade. </p>

<p>City Controller Wendy Greuel looked at the issue more broadly.</p>

<p>"It is about designing what our city is going to look like," she said. "Because today, people don't walk anywhere, do they?" That's something that needs to change, added Greuel. </p>

<p>The conversation then turned to public safety funding.</p>

<p>"For years, we have hovered just under 10,000 police officers, and we had to use city revenue to be able to maintain that," said Councilwoman Jan Perry, who oversees the 9th District, which overlaps with a good chunk of South L.A.</p>

<p>Attorney and radio show host Kevin James said L.A. should "improve the amount of officer time that we have in our communities," explaining that most patrol officers spend two-thirds of their time behind a desk, doing paperwork he described as largely unnecessary.</p>

<p>McCarthy also asked for comment on healthy housing, citing "cockroaches being pulled from ears" in some South Los Angeles housing.</p>

<p>Garcetti said he'd authored "some of the largest of toughest housing legislation in the country, and made three promises: continue to protect tenants, restore the trust fund for affordable housing to $100 million and end homelessness. <br />Greuel echoed that. "We can no longer say that it's OK for anyone to live on the streets of Los Angeles," she said. "It is unacceptable and we will not allow that to happen."</p>

<p>Perry pointed to the numerous affordable housing projects she's already completed in South L.A., saying she planned to continue building and growing funding.</p>

<p>"The greatest challenge to building affordable housing is the political will or lack thereof to do it," she said. "The greatest thing we could do for people who are homeless is build housing with support services on-site."</p>

<p>As for employment? All four candidates honed in on education.</p>

<p>"Jobs start with education, and improving public schools would be a key priority of my two terms as mayor," said James.</p>

<p>Garcetti said he'd focus on three groups in particular. "Let's put a focus on the underemployed, our youth and our veterans and get them back to work," he said.</p>

<p>On that point, McCarthy noted that the health care industry – which will need to expand due to the Affordable Care Act – is a major opportunity for job growth.</p>

<p>Toward the conclusion of the panel, one conference attendee asked the candidates what they'd do if they were not elected.</p>

<p>James said he'd run again if he lost, but added that, win or lose, he'd return to the radio airwaves and "continue to talk about city issues." Garcetti said he'd continue working in human rights activism, and Greuel said social justice would be at the core of whatever non-mayoral job she chose.</p>

<p>As for Perry? She said she'd be a Pilates instructor.</p>

<p><center>––</center></p>

<p><b>2:34 p.m.</b> – A panel on land use and gentrification in South Los Angeles focused on how "forms of push-out that are happening in our communities," as moderator Eric Ares, a community organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network, described it.</p>

<p>All four panelists focused on the importance of organizing and training so that community interests will be adequately represented in the political sphere, and described some of the barriers they've faced in trying to do so.</p>

<p>"I think the thing that's always shocking to me is the complete normalization of abuse in our community," said panelist Ashley Franklin, an organizer with the Labor Community Strategy Center. She described conversations with local students who allege police use of pepper spray, handcuffs and beatings in order to break up student fights.</p>

<p>"The same violence in that fight is the same violence the students are seeing to break up that fight," she said.</p>

<p>Pat Diaz, a panelist who's also a community leader with Strategic Actions for a Just Economy (SAJE), said many people in the community simply don't have enough energy.</p>

<p>"We have general apathy," said Diaz. "People are tired. Some people have two or three jobs," and to actively participate in community organizing on top of all that is a tall order.</p>

<p>But participation is crucial, said the panelists, especially when it comes to interacting with elected officials who are there to represent community interests.</p>

<p>"We have to hold them accountable," said Diaz. "They have to be consistent. They said this, they said that, they make all these promises while they're running, and you just have to be on top of [them].</p>

<p>"Then you make noise," she added, meaning getting the press involved or organizing protests.</p>

<p>"Our needs must be met, and we will not silenced until they're met," said Franklin.</p>

<p>One need that's not being met, according to the panelists: a healthy living space.</p>

<p>"It's not a secret that South Los Angeles is an unhealthy neighborhood," said Monic Uriarte, a community health promoter for Esperanza Community Housing Corporation. "We have houses next to factories. We have no open spaces, we have no parks, we don't have access to fresh food. The physical place affects a lot of our health."</p>

<p>Diaz echoed that, mentioning an apartment building in her neighborhood that originally used to be 11 units and was divided into 36. Parks are so small, said Diaz, that kids are forced to play in the street – which is dangerous. </p>

<p>"The physical situation does affect mental health," she said. "And mental health does give you physical ailments."</p>

<p><center>––</center></p>

<p><b>12:19 p.m.</b> – The second panel of the day focused on what Mangia said would be at the forefront of the conference: how issues in South Los Angeles relate to the international health and human rights landscape.</p>

<p>Dr. Sherif Emil, a panelist who's the director of the pediatric surgery at Montreal Children's Hospital in Canada, said health care in the U.S. is a "multiple-tired system" that creates "many second- and third- and fourth-class citizens" – something he said was "really shameful."</p>

<p>"Race makes a difference to outcomes, social status makes a difference to outcomes, zip codes make a difference to outcome," he said.</p>

<p>Emil emphasized that insurance doesn't equal access, and so it's often a "constant struggle" to get those in the safety net the care they need. </p>

<p>Emil's an American citizen, but still has access to Canada's health care system, which he said is currently in dire straits.</p>

<p>"We're facing very serious problems in terms of who is able to get into the door, who will have the door opened to them," he said. </p>

<p>Still, Emil added, there's no real sentiment that Canadians want their socialized medicine completely privatized to make the problems go away. But these problems will need to be dealt with, he said, and that'll happen through a radical transformation of the entire system. Emil is hopeful that will involve more patient-centered care and more emphasis on intentionally-crafted medical homes, which would make a concerted effort to promote accountability.</p>

<p>For now, he said, the private sector will continue to act as a stop-gap measure.</p>

<p>"Prviate health care is making bigger in-roads in Quebec than any other place in Canada because there are significant governmental failures to provide care to patients," he said."</p>

<p>Another panelist, Dr. Humberto Brocca, the director of Picas y Platicas Civil Association in Mexico City, focused on his country's drug war and how that's impacting public health. He took an optimistic tone.</p>

<p>"I would rather focus on the Chinese idea of crisis," he said. "Crisis, in Chinese, means 'opportunity in danger'.</p>

<p>"We're not afraid of the narcos, of fear itself, which is what the drug war has left to our country," he continued. Brocca said Mexico City's biggest challenge was "street children and the homeless population," and that he's had to be resourceful in how he alleviates the issue.</p>

<p>"We train the kids to treat the kids, which has sometimes brought the health community against us," he said. "But we don't mind that – we care about the beneficiaries of our program." </p>

<p>The third panelist, Jorge Schafik Handal, is the executive director of Alba Alimentos in El Salvador, which focuses on creating food justice. He talked about his involvement in the effort to make agriculture in the country more robust, thus creating jobs, chipping away at the social exclusion of agricultural workers and strengthening Salvadoran food security and sovereignty.</p>

<p>Said Emil, "The challenge in any true health care reform…is a paradox of health care. It's something that will eventually affect every one of us. On the other hand, at any one point in time, most of us are not involved in health care decisions. So how do you get a population to take hold and take possession of the health care system?"</p>

<p>Education is the answer to that, he said.</p>

<p><center>––</center></p>

<p><b>11:05 a.m.</b> – Senator Curren Price, who represents South Los Angeles in the state Senate, made an appearance to commend the conference's "supporting organizations," including event's host, St. John's Well Child and Family Center.</p>

<p>"Just to rely on government is not enough," he said to conference attendees. "So it's important that we act in a proactive manner and collaborate."</p>

<p>Added Price, "It's important that we talk about the issues associated with human rights, with health, with education, with social services, with housing, because they are interrelated. They don't stand alone."</p>

<p><center>––</center></p>

<p><b>10:44 a.m.</b> – The day's first official panel focused on how participants could use the political process to move their cause of leveling health inequalities forward.</p>

<p>Moderator Laphonza Butler, who's also the president of the largest union in California – SEIU United Long Term Care Workers – said there are three parts to the "recipe for change": leading, uniting and working.</p>

<p>Panelists emphasized political participation.</p>

<p>"The easiest thing for [politicians] to do is ignore communities who don't deliver votes for them," said Commissioner Mike Neely of the Los Angeles Homeless Authority. "No matter how we want to structure it, politics play an extremely important role in all of the things that we want to get accomplished. Social justice has been accomplished in our country through the political process."</p>

<p>On a more grassroots level, panelist Areva Martin, the president and co-founder of the Special Needs Network, said listening to local residents and constituents is important – especially if you're coming from outside the community.</p>

<p>"It's not our job to impose on our community," said Martin.</p>

<p>That's especially true for young people, said the third panelist, Charisse Weaver.</p>

<p>"Young people, as future leaders, are very aware of what issues they want to be engaged and involved in," said Weaver, who's president and CEO of the Brotherhood Crusade. </p>

<p>The panelists touched upon the issues they engaged: Neely said homelessness in South L.A. is the worst in the county, and that "serious problems" with the foster care system often contribute to that. He said expanding communities' ability to provide homeless services and more affordable housing ought to be part of a potential solution.</p>

<p>For her part, Martin referred to the "fragmented" system of care for special needs folks in the area, pointing to a state legislative victory she helped drive last year that mandates that private insurance companies cover autism therapies. That victory, she said, was just a start.</p>

<p>"The problem is this big, but your solution starts off a little smaller because you have to work in stages to get to where you want to be," said Martin. The next step: getting Medi-Cal to cover those therapies.</p>

<p>The running theme of the panelists' conversation was the importance of self-starting.</p>

<p>"If we cannot help ourselves, how can we expect anyone else to help us in our own community?" asked Weaver. </p>

<p>Added Neely, "Are you going to be an agent of change, or is change going to you?</p>

<p>"We can, as a community, begin the process of making things different, but we have to make sure we understand what our vision is," he added. "And without that vision, we're in trouble."</p>

<p><center>––</center></p>

<p><b>9:41 a.m.</b> – A rousing speech by L.A. County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas focused on overcoming inaccurate perceptions of the South L.A. community, especially when it came to the reopening of Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital, whose previous incarnation was beleaguered by a reputation of incompetence. </p>

<p>"No matter what the Los Angeles Times or anybody else says, as far as I'm concerned, Martin Luther King hospital will open, it'll be better than ever before and it'll set a standard for the nation as to how you can arrest distressing circumstances" and be an example of hope, Ridley-Thomas said.</p>

<p>The supervisor added that it was about "moving from action to change."</p>

<p>"We are here to make our statement and we will do so, and in so doing make the whole county of Los Angeles better," he said. "And that's what's going on right now."</p>

<p><center>––</center></p>

<p><b>9:32 a.m.</b> – With some politically charged opening remarks, Mangia said the "re-election of Barack Obama means that health reform is now the law of the land and we will never go back."</p>

<p>"What this means is that we have historic opportunities and openings through Obamacare to address the longstanding inequities" in South L.A, he said. </p>

<p>But while Obama's re-election marked a victorious battle, "we are still in the midst of the war," he said, noting the southside's high incidence of adult diabetes and child asthma, which he called the worst in the state. He also pointed to South L.A.'s lack of parks and healthy food options.</p>

<p>"There is no rest for the weary," he said, calling for participants to "engage the social determinants that cause ill health in our communities."</p>

<p>"Be assured of one thing," said Mangia. "We will never go back."</p>

<p><center>––</center></p>

<p><b>9:17 a.m.</b> – Hundreds are expected to gather today at St. John's Well Child and Family Center for the third annual <a href="../../06/south-la-conference-will-focus-areas-health-and-hu/index.html" target="_blank">South Los Angeles Health & Human Rights Conference</a>. Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas is set to take the stage any moment to kick off the day with some opening remarks.</p>

<p>On the conference website, organizers post that 30 percent of the area's adults are uninsured, and that five South L.A. emergency rooms have closed since the turn of the millennium. St. John's president and CEO Jim Mangia told OnCentral on Thursday that the region is in the midst of a "health and human rights crisis."</p>

<p>"We've got to really take this bull by the horns and bring attention to the fact that there are large, significant pockets of our population in the United States of America who don't have access to basic health care and human rights situations," he said Thursday. "So that's what the Health & Human Rights Conference is doing, it's bringing attention to that."</p>

<p>OnCentral will be live-blogging the conference.</p>

        <p>YJ Draiman says that voters deserve to hear from all Mayoral candidates on the ballot </p>

<p>It is anti democratic to ignore candidates who have earned their place to be on the ballot.</p>

<p>In the current political mood and the growing apathy by voters it is imperative that every candidate who is officially on the ballot to be heard by the public.</p>

<p>Ignoring these candidates only reinforces to the voting public that money and not the most qualified candidate is given a chance to run for office with a level playing field.</p>

<p>The deck is stacked against a candidate who is not willing to be swayed by money and political influence. This is a sad day for our Democracy.</p>

<p>The Media and the various organizations who host a candidate forum – debate have a great responsibility to present unbiased information to the public, of all the candidates that appear on the ballot with a level playing field.</p>

<p>To ignore some candidates is a distortion of our Democratic oath and they are practicing the very same unacceptable behavior that they are trying to correct in today’s political scene. </p>

<p>By ignoring candidates who are on the ballot the voters are deprived of critical information and opinions of all the candidates on the ballot. It is a disservice to the community at large.</p>

<p>Angelenos have the right to an open and balanced election process resting on the values of our democracy, which is open to all candidates.</p>

<p>We have to show to the public how real democracy at work – by presenting all the candidates, not just the select few.</p>

<p>The right to vote is the right that protects all other rights. That includes all official candidates.</p>
